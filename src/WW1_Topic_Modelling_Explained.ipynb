    "Topic modelling is a form of unsupervised machine learning which is especially good at finding meaning in large, unstructured, text documents. The method has gained a lot of interest from a wide array of fields due to its potential for finding semantic information and visualising this in an appealing and understandable way. As a method, it certainly has a unique ability to detect patterns and extract insights from datasets which are usually out of reach for other machine learning approaches. This may be due to their messy structure and/or scale. However, anyone working with topic modelling should take care to document their pre-processing of the data before feeding it to the model. This is because the steps taken to slice and dice the words will play a big role in the topics which come out."

       "'Dear wife my two kids and all my family I will tell you that I have reached Magnac and we are leaving for Paris next Thursday to go to the border of Germany I will tell you that since Sunday I have not eaten two cents of food when at the moment I have 50000000 ideas in my head but anyway I am not sick I will tell you that we arrested a German spy and I guarantee you that he is not at the end of his sentences There are three spies who were executed but not in Magnac very close to Paris this is the last letter I am writing to you because afterwards I think that I will not be able anymore or if I rewrite it will be when I get to Paris At the moment it seems that things are going badly but I will fight to the end for the honor of all to save you if I can and all my comrades I promised you almost solemnly to tell you the truth I will do it but on the other hand you gave me the assurance that you would have strong nerves and a firm heart I have been since this morning in conquered trenches for 2 days all of these trenches and guts forms a real labyrinth where I wandered 3 hours last night absolutely lost The traces of the ardent struggle are numerous and striking and first of all they are more than half destroyed by the hurricane of grape shot that our artillery threw there so they are inconvenient and horribly dirty in spite of the urgent repairs which we made there everything is missing water clean or dirty hoses latrines they are less than 200 meters from the 1st enemy line with which they communicate by sealed guts they are strewn with French and German corpses without almost disturbing me I counted 20 frozen in the most macabre attitudes This neighborhood is not yet foulsmelling but it still hurts the eyes this morning at 5 oclock we arrived wet and exhausted and I entered the first shelter to relax I noticed a good board lay down on it found it soft but 5 minutes later I noticed that she made a bedstead on 2 German corpses well believe me it still does something at least the first time We are cooking loudly all around us and it really is sometimes a din already I hardly greet any more The evil is not there it is especially in the weather which is dreadful For at least 3 days gusts of rain have followed showers the guts are unspeakable quagmires where one slips where one gets dreadfully muddy so I am superlative at least to the waist my hands are muddy and will remain so until departure my shoes are full of water fortunately the body is dry for the air is almost cold and the sky livid Around me people are making a face It will take a lot of patience and moraleWe are wearing the new sheet steel helmet it is heavy and inconvenient but it gives serious protection against bursts of fusants and against ricochets so one carries it without grumbling We also have a lot of gear against asphyxiating gases But we will be poorly supplied only one meal at night which will usually arrive cold and this is explained both by the length of the guts and by the difficulty of traversing a large uncovered area To this somewhat dark but true picture two corrective measures should be added first we will have a defensive role we are responsible for rehabilitating the very upset sector then the Germans counterattacked little owing to the lack of manpower and the state of their affairs in Champagne For these 2 reasons it may very well be that we do not have to look them in the eye this is also the unanimous wish here My letter will reach you in the midst of a period of resettlement and worries I will try to take my part from afar it will distract me and merge me a little more with you I wish you calm and courage to triumph over these small difficulties You know how much I love you and what tender kisses I send you share with our dear little ones I absolutely approve of your decision regarding Catherines kind offer My Daddy Mom Little Sister join me in wishing you a happy new year and good health and hugging you with all our heart Last year  that day I had the joy of kissing you but this year a Cursed Character took this happiness away from me but having your photograph I cover it with my tenderest kisses with the firm hope that you will return to us safe and sound this Victory year after having accomplished the most sacred of Duties towards our beloved Fatherland Today Saturday I am writing to let you know that we are still in Magnac at this time We are not yet all dressed because in the regiment that we are going to form which is the 90th territorial we are several classes 95969798 and 99 who is me of the youngest The reserve of active like us was made up of several classes They left around Paris while we are told that we are leaving on Monday without knowing the direction Everything remains secret some say that we are even going to Africa to replace the troops which have returned others to La Rochelle or to Paris in the forts It is even said that we are going to harvest in Champagne and that is where we are going to drink good wine I saw Lucien the same day in the evening that had just arrived Were pretty much done dressing  we dressed as we liked no one told us anything We lay down in the straw and sleep then we eat like pigs We could each go to sleep at home while we wait for the order to leave Me Im in the 12th company There are still two or three active army reserve classes to return which will pass us on the way We are good people and do not have bad blood because if you see us we hardly worry we I am writing to you lying on the grass coming out of a nap Dont worry and see you soon  Dear Mother and Brother All I recommend to you is to take care of my two children as well as the beloved Margueritte As long as me do not count on me anymore because we are going to a butchers shop human My last thought for my mother my wife and my two children as well as all my family whom I once loved so much and will always love as long as I see you from afar We must hope that one day we will be in the space of the sun Kiss my little ones very hard for me At the 338th of Magnac Laval I will tell you that we are a lot of Saint Junien If you want to reply write as soon as you receive my letter Dont be bored Bravery I hope to bring a Prussian helmet Farewell Long live France I am still in good health Im not running any risk Men are still digging trenches and gutters Since yesterday we left our bivouac to go to a cantonment closer to the front We are with artillerymen hunters on horseback engineers on foot and hussars We are much better than in tents We have to go to rest on June 5th I find pretty much anything I want do not send money or parcel to me before I ask you to The area is still calm we work all day and only hear a few hits from 75 I want to tell you that the Germans can attack where we are The unfortunate ones they are well awaited You cant imagine everything that has been done since the war such as trenches machine gun shelters and gunslingers As much as it comes so much will be left For their part it may be the same No more nothing new Your son who loves you  I come to ask you how you are and if you have any news from Louis I have been isolated for 5 weeks in the middle of dirty and disgusting limousins who treat us as real German prisoners I lead an idle life and get away from it all I hope to have the pleasure of returning to the north soon before being designated to leave for the fields because I have number 3 and it could happen at some point to the other In any case I cannot regret this region in any way and anywhere I can go I will be happy to go because here it is really good to wonder if it is still France   Im not complaining about military life at the moment We could certainly get better but alas there are much worse too Please God that we emerge victorious from this terrible hour and that your husband and mine join their homes intact from the struggle Your devoted cousin  My dear adored I am writing to you on my bag in the trenches we have been there day and night for 9 days The Zouaves the tirailleurs and the blacks have arrived They tried to move forward by crossing by means of a bridge the canal from Nieggport to Ypres which is in front of us at 5 minutes but the enemy is there at 700m which sends them heavy fire 17 Zouaves fall and are forced to retreat I cannot tell you how long we will stay here Mouhaud de Saingnemousoude was killed in a ombat on October 22 we have 12 dead in the regiment we were in the 1st line Eugene Thomas has a cut finger he is evicted The dirty boches bombard all the churches especially I do not see any more newspapers I do not know how it goes elsewhere we knew in spite of that the success of the Russian army I cant wait for them to arrive in Berlin because its starting to take a long time Im still in good health and I think the same is true of you our friends and all the family You tell me that you are going to go to the country maybe you have left I received your letter on the 29th I will send the letter to Paris if you are gone the concierge will do it well if we could not do it You could stay in Laprugne often as often as possible It is claimed that the war will end in Belgium it is a flat country but we have been facing the enemy for 10 days and we have not been able to dislodge them I do not need anything at the moment I have a knit that I have touched with the company I still have money When I need something Ill tell you We drink water when we find it or beer but there is no more Wine is very rare It is worth 1 franc 75 a bottle but where the Germans have spent there is nothing left With money you can have nothing We are the 1st territorial fire there must be a question of politics I dont know if well be left there You will write to me as often as you can Instead of Magnac Laval you will put military center I end by hugging you and the whole family with all my heart If you havent left hello friends The German shells pass over our heads and will explode backwards a few bullets from time to time our artillery responds to them You will have to arrange to receive your allowance in the country not to give it to them I wrote my letter yesterday I will try to make it leave I will free it at 0 francs 25 you will tell me if it was there because we are still in the trenches the airplanes pass and are attacked by the German army without touching them The weather is fine but its a funny Halloween Give me news of your brothers and Gaston Your father still hasnt answered me This is not cheerful because we are very poorly supplied but you have to be courageous two planes have just shot at each other without hitting each other It is the first German plane that we see He fired 15 cannon shots without being hit  Dear parents I arrived in Croissy it was around 7 am planes It made a terrible thunderstorm and there was plenty of water falling without being able to find any shelter It didnt last long but the short time it got us wet anyway However we had some dry effects to change us Today it did not rain on the contrary the weather was fine We are fairly well quartered We have straw in suufisance and I believe that we will stay there Goodbye dear parents My dear Ginette I am writing to tell you that I have known death up close that night but now everything is fine I have seen my whole life pass before my eyes Due to shellfire in my trench the alcove where I slept collapsed two of my comrades died in the collapse I got a beam on my leg my leg got infected and the doctors had to cut my leg off Now I dont risk anything anymore because they transferred me outside the combat zone I can tell you that I am happy to have left this hell with the rats the lice the crabs the mud the macabés the artillery fire of all kinds Even if I told you in my previous letters its horrible here the smell of his comrades who have been dead for three days But despite all this misfortune and all this hatred I keep thinking of you you Ginette You light up my heart like the sun rising on the battlefield still smoking from the shells of the day before What could my Darling your little husband find more agreeable than to be able to write you a little note in this sad situation to tell you all my dear ones that in this day I am still well and at the same time as always I hope and desire with all my heart that you all enjoy very good health Peace does not come quickly on our poor land overthrown by modern science turned into unbridled barbarism Finally let us always have the hope that this dreadful calamity will end like everything else in this world Last night I did not get my good letter Tonight I look forward to it Time does not pass quickly enough My beloved Valentine I still hope so Ah how happy I will be when I will be near you forever Courage and hope Heart always beautiful I end for today my dear ones by kissing you wholeheartedly How I love you Your dear little one who loves you very much hugging my darling little wife  My Darling this morning I received a letter from you dated 3 It gave me great pleasure to know that you are in excellent health For me its still going very well but tonight Im sorry I thought I was going to finish today but I was unlucky In the morning we had 2 devices to shoot and they were both broken then after noon to make matters worse it rained all evening so we couldnt fly Provided that the weather is fine tomorrow because I have had enough of this country then I cant wait to see you again Finally I hope the weather will be fine and that I can finish quickly so that I can be near you on Saturday or Sunday morning In this hope I end by kissing you very hard and for a long time on your beloved mouth  Yesterday throughout the journey the people in a hurry at level crossings and stations did not stop cheering us the women sending kisses the men taking over with us the Marseillaise and the Chant du Départ Why Must a deaf anguish take hold of my heart If it were in operation it would be very amusing but here it is the day after tomorrow in 3 days perhaps the bullets will rain and who knows was not going to come back if I was going to kill my mother murder my mother on purpose Oh whats in store for me Sorry mom I should have stayed working my cello for you for you who made so many sacrifices for a little mother already sick  You cannot get an idea my dear how unhappy we are so yet I am not too used to complaining but this time I have to because it is one thing beyond the imaginable it is not to be able to say to you In this tunnel we are an affair of 3000 men in reserve in a humidity because the water trickles all along the walls and there However we have to sleep there on the railway line We go to look for food in the middle of the night near Verdun accompanied all along the way by the shells which means that we can only have one meal a day and without soup To get to the front lines it is very painful and very dangerous about a kilometer before arriving there is a passage called the ravine of death who knows the men that there is killed in there you have to go through it there is no other place  I will tell you that we refused to line up on Tuesday night we did not want to march we almost went on strike and many other regiments did as we did You know if it is clean  When I go in perme I will tell you better They take us for animals make us walk like that and not much to eat and still get smashed to nothing we would have mounted the attack it would have remained half of it and we would not have advanced for that Well I dont know what will become of it things are going very badly for the moment May be that you will not receive my letter they will perhaps open them and those where we tell what is happening they will keep them or burn them  I dont care I dont care have had enough of their war  My sweet Therese I havent written to you for a few days but you see here in the trenches its cold My fingers are numb its barely if I can still handle my rifle The living conditions for soldiers like me have become unbearable Every second we have to fight against hunger cold sleep and fear Because yes we are afraid Fear of seeing Germans appear at any time The interior of the trenches is muddy This mud is found everywhere even in the bread that we eat once youve touched it It also tastes quite unpleasant But we are not allowed to be choosy since food is increasingly scarce Rats have also invaded our trenches They are huge and even uglier than the ones I have seen on the farm And more wicked Not long ago they killed a dog and ate it Killing has become a habit for me Its horrible to say but its the truth These three years of war have made monsters of me and all my companions Great battles such as the one at Verdun last year which claimed more than 680000 lives are clear proof of this We have all given up hope that this massacre will ever end When I left even if leaving you was heartbreaking for me I was smiling because I believed the State when it told us that it would only be a matter of months that we would quickly come back to find our little one quiet life All the soldiers believed him The point is its the third Christmas Im going to be away from you and more than half of the men Ive gone with have already died They all had parents friends family some were even fathers They will never see their loved ones again And all these children will grow up alone because their father left to die for the homeland But the state is guilty of an even bigger lie One of our comrades returned from leave a few weeks ago He brought us some newspapers to show us what civilians are told about the war Enemy bullets would have no effect on us And the neighbors son then how did he die Another article also spoke of Verdun precisely So that way the shelters had all the necessary comforts such as heating or electricity According to the soldier when he wanted to contradict this collection of lies the civilians did not believe him They were convinced that what was written is none other than the truth How can it be so I hope you are not one of those people or that this letter will change your mindSome of my companions because they could not live far from their families without seeing their children grow up resorted to voluntary mutilation Our superiors noticed this and these soldiers will be shot this evening How can the state do this All these soldiers are fighting for men in higher positions who themselves stay warm by developing pseudostrategies However at the slightest sign of weakness as soon as the desire to stop killing is felt the government does not hesitate to kill these soldiers when they are men from its homeland who would have been ready to give their lives for France Let them take care of the damn Boches who duck us from morning to night It is like the affair of the martyrs of Vingré These poor men were guilty of nothing except for wanting to escape the enemy You must be wondering why I am telling you all this today when in my previous letters I had it seem to be happy Heres the reason censorship is watching She reads every letter of ours and as soon as a letter is a little pessimistic it is destroyed The government makes you believe that we are going to win this war that the soldiers die happy for their homeland that we always have our fill and that we do not suffer from the cold This is all wrong and I want you to know the truth But I know you will receive this letter because the bakers son has permission I asked him to give you this letter Can you thank him by cooking something for him Youve always had a knack for cooking Hope our son is doing well I have only seen him twice since he was born I hope I will have another permission soon to be able to visit you These days away from you two are getting more and more unbearable All my love in this letter for you and our child My dear mother I will probably surprise you by telling you that it was almost without regret that I left Paris but it is the truth What do you want I noticed like all my comrades that these two years of war had gradually brought about selfishness and indifference among the civilians and that we combatants were almost forgotten I will therefore try to forget how I have been forgotten it will certainly be more difficult and yet I had had a very nice dream for two years What a desappointment  Now I will feel good alone May the hazards of war not cripple me forever rather death is now my only hope Dear Marie I am writing two letter words to tell you that follows in good health and I want my letter to find you all too I am still in the hospital but not for long if I had stayed for 15 days I would have had a leave of 6 days I dont know where it comes from I write every day and I dont get reply I look forward to hearing from you soon I see much more to say for today I end by kissing you with all my heart Good morning to you all  Very dear husband I am writing you these few lines to give you our news which is always very good for the moment the whole family is like this and I think that my letter to you will find the same We received your letter on Tuesday which gives us great pleasure to hear from you which I expected every day We received Panorama tones on Friday The little ones were very happy is your little girl who talks every day about her daddy who is very cute My dear Antoine I received my allowances on Saturday evening at 3 am twenty francs from January 15th But if you need anything then let me know Belugeon gave me 3 bushels of clover 3 days since the cows were out of the field Every day it rains a lot and its cold its a bad weather I cant see much more to say to you but dont get bad blood on us you can rest easy now I end my letter by kissing you with all my heart many times Your wife Good morning from all the family  Dear Mr Welsh\\\\n\\\\nWe were only out here a matter of a few hours before we went into the trenches we were there for eight days and then came on to what is called a Rest Camp I suppose it is called that to distinguish it from the trenches because the men are at work all day road and trench making and it comes under both rifle and artillery fire We got here at 7 oclock yesterday morning and were shelled at 9 oclock\\\\n\\\\nIn the trenches it was fairly bad they are so narrow and smelly and one is being potted at and shelled all the time A turn of eight days was really quite long enough because it is strenuous work and even when you do turn in for a rest you have to be ready to turn out at once on an alarm\\\\n\\\\nThe country is really quite pretty and just like the hills and valleys of South Wales but there are no brooks or rivers It rains hard for a month each year usually about this time and then there is no more until the next rainy season But although it is so gloriously sunny something is wrong with the place and it really isnt as healthy as it looks I think the flies have something to do with it as well as the heat and the still unburied dead bodies about There are millions and millions of flies here and they are all over everything Put a cup of tea down without a cover and it is immediately covered with dead ones they are all round your mouth and directly you open it to speak or to eat in they pop It is a game We have all got nets of course we should have been worried no medicine by now if we hadnt\\\\n\\\\nWe get plenty of bully beef and army biscuits but bread and fresh meat is still a luxury and it is not possible to buy anything It must have been a No Mans Land because there are no houses or buildings of any kind to be seen and except the flies the only living things are green canaries and lizards\\\\n\\\\nWe live in dugouts built up the reverse sides of the hills They are just holes really but all the same they can be made very comfortable with a bit of digging and a few waterproof sheets They are not shell proof by any means and the one I slept in during my first night here was knocked in completely by a shell pitching right into it Fortunately I was not at home at the time We have another now and I must try and get a photo of it and let you see what it is like I must send you one of our\\\\n\\\\nMess dugout too\\\\n\\\\nEverything here is named after the Regiment responsible for the making or taking For instance the road we made from our trenches to this camp is called New Bedford Rd and the ridge we took and now occupy is called on the army maps Bedford Ridge I have just been filling in and colouring my map and find it is one of the most if not the most advanced line of the lot Standing on that ridge it is possible to see what a lot of country we have taken and now hold but there is nothing to get wildly excited about Each position is strengthened as much as possible before another attempt is made to push on and the whole thing is just steady progress Something might happen suddenly I only hope it does\\\\n\\\\nWe have had some very big ships out here and they have been bombarding the forts heavily now for some few days and there are cruisers monitors etc standing in the bay helping the land batteries to shell the trenches You see a flash and then wait a long time before hearing the boom and the shriek of the shell passing over our heads almost together then look round quickly and see the burst of the shell in or over the trenches sometimes before hearing the explosion The first we know of shells aimed at us is the bang of the explosion and it is too late to get out of the way Three officers were laid flat on their backs the other day without any hurt except to their dignity and farther on six men were buried without one being injured It isnt always like that though\\\\n\\\\nThere is quite good bathing here when we can find time to go As the beach is in full view of the enemy and comes under their shell fire it would not appeal to the nervous We never keep closer together than ten yards when we are undressing and swimming in hopes that the Turk will not consider one man worth the price of a shell We have had some casualties through the men keeping too close together but after washing out of a teacup for a week or more it is worth a bit of risk to get rid of some of the trench dust and smell and feel and look clean again And really is the best bathing Ive ever had The water is quite warm and clear\\\\n\\\\nAll the hospital work is done on board a ship that stands in the bay If the cases are serious or lengthy they are transferred to one of the hospital ships that calls daily and then go to either one of the bases or back to England We land troops night or day in spite of the fact that they come under fire so it is possible for a man to be on his way back wounded by the same ship that bought him from the base without ever having landed\\\\n\\\\nWe had a grand voyage out All the officers had either staterooms or 1st Class cabins and the food mostly was just the same as we should have had on an ordinary cruise to India or Australia wherever it is that the Cruise Line calls The usual cabin stewards and waiters were in attendance and it was difficult to remember that we were not exactly on a pleasure trip We did enjoy those two weeks\\\\n\\\\nKind regards\\\\n\\\\nYours sincerely\\\\n\\\\nHW Cronin Lieutenant\\\\n\\\\nI am acting as captain until some of the others come back from hospital Dear Nic BoyceThanks very much for your interesting letter I wondered when I would hear from someone at the office Also many thanks for your good wishes and congratulations on my marriage which I have conveyed to my wife I am sure she will thank you all very muchWell to tell you a little about our experiences we started off mysteriously one Sunday from Devonport on the captured German liner Derflinger not a bad boat The Warrant Officers had 2nd class quarters it was all right Food was very fair Submarine pickets every night for one of the four companies lights out at seven or half past Stole by Gibraltar at night in a fog expecting it to be torpedoed We did reach Malta in due course after skirting north African coast spent a day there went ashore had a few drinks which we needed being very hot and then on to Alexandria for three days ashore every night not a bad place of course the lower men didnt go except for a route march on the Saturday Our movements were kept very secret and we couldnt find out what was to be done with our division we then pushed to Port Said and had a day there All of a sudden we received orders to sail and soon found we were off to Gallipoli as we were passing through the Aegean sea which is as you know full of pretty islands Some hours before reaching Lemnos the naval guns could be heard booming and we ran into the magnificent harbour there full of shipping and life After a day there we pushed on to Imbros 4½ miles from Sulva Bay during the afternoon they treated us to a naval shelling of Achi Baba which is really the other side of the peninsula but they shoot over the hills and mountains here It was a fine sight and many of our chaps went sick at once At night Sunday 9815 our good ship made for Anafarta Bay where a new landing had been effected two days before 900 rounds four days rations each as much as a man is expected to carry and they dumped us over the side in lighters a type of flatbottomed barge at 7am a short journey through the boom defences and we were ashore waiting for something to turn up\\\\n\\\\nBivouacked on the beach and were put on unloading lighters till about 10 when the Turks spotted us and started shelling two men killed and four wounded to start with and we lost a few more wounded during the day although naturally we took what cover we could I had one or two near me whilst getting a timber out of the hold of a lighter but managed to dodge them all right At night my company received orders to take picks and shovels up into the firing line which was about five miles away half way up Chocolate Hill Well Nic the 10th were soon in the thick of it as we advanced across the salt lake in extended order\\\\n\\\\nRifle fire now we had to dodge and many of our chaps got hit rather seriously I have since found out I was glad of a rest at the foot of the hill but had to push on again and deliver the goods after feeling about in the dark for some time our guide led us in single file up behind the firing line where we laid down bullets were whistling round but we managed to escape them The enemy were yelling for all they were worth and I was glad when our captain ordered us down again to the beach This took us some hours and when we reached the place the other three had gone up to reinforce the firing line so up we went again the next day about 6pm nearly all things are done here in the dark as we are in view all the time We again advanced across the take from Lala Baba my heels were nearly raw through new boots and I eventually had to rest for a fortnight later on Well on our right was a hill burning furiously with many a chap caught in the flames and so perishing not our regiment\\\\n\\\\nWe finished on rather a feathered bed and did not find the other Company til next day it was a night we were all parched with the heat and no water Dried up and had to dig ourselves in its no light job this hiding being like an ostrich til you make a hole large enough to get into and make yourself head cover Dear LackMany thanks for the photographs received We all think they are good and on Saturday the six of us had out photo taken here in a similar position in khaki The two pictures together should make a lasting mementoWe have had little spare time since we have been training here Having been through company drill mixed with route marches physical drill semaphore knot tying and frog long jumping etc Some of our men were able to go to town on Saturday but I myself with a few others have been under orders for overseas service now waiting to proceed so popping up town seems out of the question for us We are numbered in alphabetical order and in the order we are sent out We are now fully equipped I enclose  postage for the photographs If you are printing any more you might save me one as I am afraid I have spoilt mine it got bent in my overcoat pocket on Saturday Please remember me to all at the office Boyce Dear BertJust a few lines to let you know I am alright hoping you are the same At the present time we are in dugouts The weather is simply awful raining day after day and especially night after nightTo tell you the truth while writing this letter I am wet through to the skin and not a dry thing for a change We have got our winter fur coats and gum boots but the latter cause more curses than you can imagine for instance last night I was sent off to select dugouts for our platoon which is number 37 It was pitch dark no light allowed and in a strange place well honestly I fell over at least 20 times got smothered in mud from head to feet and on the top of that wet though for it rained in torrents On a round of inspection this morning to see if all were comfortable I was blinded up hill and down dale Sergeant this and Sergeant thatHow can you expect men to live in this and then to put a dampener on the lot was the language from the occupiers who unfortunately were in a residence that fell in during the night They took shelter under a tree from 2am after looking for me for half an hour or so but they could not find me for the only thing that would shift me after settling down if I may call it that would be a Jack Johnson and then I would have no optionWhile in the trenches last week John and I were up to our knees in water and got our gum boots half full The line is a bit quiet lately and only now and again do we get a shelling but one gets used to it That to give you an idea is like sitting at Paddington and hearing the engines screechAfter our stretch this time I shall be looking forward for a short leave for I have been here nearly three months now and we stand a good chance Well I must now concludeYours sincerely Jack SymonsPS Every other home down near the rest camp is an Estaminet small French café where they sell what they call beer and as much as I like a drop of good beer I have given the stuff out here best for is awful muc Dear Mr HuntPlease accept yourself and convey to the other gentlemen my best thanks for the State Express cigarettes They are fine Oh what a picnic it is in the trenches just now We have been in the trenches 10 days up to now and except for the last two days it has been raining almost steadily The result is mud mud and yet more mud knee deep in places But luckily we have long top boots from trench wear so that the mud does not worry as much except that is making our feet as cold as ice We have been issued with fur jackets so we can keep our bodies warmJust now the whole countryside is covered with snow and moving objects are distinguishable a long distance off For instance this morning when I was on duty with the gun I could see the Germans walking down a road away behind their lines I had several bursts at them with the gun but they were out of range Made me damned mad I can tell you seeing the blighters and then not being able to lay them outYou cant realise the power one seems to possess when handling a Maxim Personally I feel as if I could lay out the whole German army We fire about a couple of thousand rounds every night into Fritzs trenches just to keep them quiet They the Germans have been trying to find the gun both with their Maxims and with shells but up to now theyve not succeed Kind regards to everybody Yours very sincerelyGilbert Williams I might say we are all merry and bright and not down hearted yet\\\\n\\\\nDear Mr Hunt\\\\n\\\\nReceived card alright for which I must thank you very much We are still at Longmoor and no signs of moving as I have been made cooks mate and had to work very hard all through Xmas\\\\n\\\\nSapper Hodges As long as you kept your head down you were comparatively safe so as it went on this was where I had my first escape I was on sentry duty for a couple of hours from 1am to 3am and was instructed to keep a sharp look out I did not care for the idea of keeping my head above the trench and looking for beastly Germans however it had to be done it was quite uncanny to watch the enemy trench which appeared somewhat like a black wave and only sixty yards in front then you would suddenly see the flash of their rifles and machine guns immediately after would come the report and nasty thuds on the sandbags which you might be resting against I fired about five shots at their flashes the only target to aim at then another two shells which lodged in the parapet either side of my head leaving about 2 to 3 inches between me and certain death I thought that near enough but it turned out that it was to have something nearer than that Our casualties here amounted on the average to about two per day killed of course we thought it terrible at the time at least I did Early April saw us relieved by another division and we were sent a few miles back for a wellearned rest which consisted of physical drill and a run before breakfast The remainder of the morning being spent in platoon drill musketry drills After dinner we put the cap on our rest why so called I do not know by having a route march for two hours We spent a few days like this and were dispatched with all possible speed to Ypres here we went in to support the Canadians and spent a most unpleasant eight days during which time we lost several hundred men nearly all my friends who came out in the same draft and were killed or wounded we had to retire the best part being that the Germans did not find this out until two days after when we were more or less safely bivouacking in a very pretty wood We stayed here for about a week then we got to work again digging reserve trenches just behind the front line building up parapets which had been demolished by the enemys high explosive shells and such like working all night and getting what sleep we could in the daytime One morning we were awakened by the most awful din it seemed as though hell had broken loose shells were falling like summer rain And people have often told me in the course of conversation it was raining shells and I admit I took it with a grain of salt could not be possible I thought but such I was surprised to find was possible and actually taking place there about 330am This bombardment started and about half an hour later I with three others were ordered to start reinforcing We went up in fours it being considered safer that way half a mile over open ground we had to do this being swept continually with shells to give you a slight idea I can say the previous night just in front of our reserve trenches was a beautifully green field and the next morning it was as much as one could do to see any grass at all simply one mass of craters varying in diameter from ten to twelve paces\\\\n\\\\nI had gone about half the required distance when a shell fell only a yard from where I was the force of the concussion explosion pitched me several yards to my left and I came down rather heavily however I reached the first line without any further mishap where we had to stay until midnight when we had to be relieved again owing to not having enough me to hold the trench Our honours were one VC Victoria Cross two DSO  Distinguished Service Orders one Military Cross and one or two DCM Distinguished Conduct MedalsThe next day I paraded sick my back paining me so much that I could not stand straight for a week after I am now back with the regiment who are on the line of communications We are having leave shortly and if possible will pay a visit to the Audit office Have you any news of Chichester Yours trulyRifleman EHC Stewart This trench of ours is a model in its own way being fairly safe and connected by good communication trenches The Commanding Officers house of white sandbags is fitted with window curtains and window box with pansies in it It is furnished with table and chairs also a large mirror Of course this is quite a one occasion affair and dont imagine we are here town planning with model dwellings etc But it will show you how soldiers can adapt themselves to circumstances At the back of our trench is ripening corn and plenty of wildflowers in bloomWe have also canaries in cages in the trench But these are used by the miners for testing the air in the mines after the explosion to see if it was possible to finish off their job Censored line captured from the Germans a short time ago and during the stay we were kept busy with sandbags etc and at night of course had to especially watch the enemy When in the reserve or support trenches fatigue work has to be done every night such as carrying food ammunition material for the engineers etc to the firing line so you can guess it is nothing but continual bob work odd jobs Dear Mr Hunt Many thanks for your welcome letter volunteering so much interesting news of friends at the office I wrote to Standew just before receiving your letter but no doubt a few more lines will be acceptable Beaumont seems to be doing the best of us all I saw Williams and Hull about three weeks ago in a small town near here Of course the Seaforths and Argylls regiments always move about together but we dont meet very often I am glad to hear the old section is still in being and not like the German Empire is fast becoming a thing of the past And hope your three survivors will be allowed to keep the flag flying until the wanderers return I have been in the firing line several times and at four different places besides being in the support trenches at others I hear this is called a mobile division which accounts for our gipsy life in France Our last turn in the firing line for six days and six in the reserve was the most exciting of all It has been a quiet place for two months until two days after our occupation when the British exploded mines under some workings of the Germans near their trenches to prevent them blowing our trench up Well That woke them up and the following Saturday they retaliated by opening rapid fire early in the morning However we were ready for them and quickly replied so they then bombarded us which to say the least of it was a noisy business That eventually ceased and rapid firing was quickly in process again followed by another shelling which our guns again put a stop to The whole affair lasted an hour and ten minutes and although we believe an attack was intended the Germans didnt leave their trench opposite to us After putting our trench in order again which took some time as the parapet was blown down for about three yards near me and a shell burst amongst a lot of beef tins scattering them and the contents in all directions besides the bottom of the trench being littered with hundreds of empty cartridges we proceeded with boiling water for tea also to show the Huns by the smoke that we were still there Only a hundred yards separated the two trenches so it was always a case of bob down and the enemy were good shots as we found out to our cost when they smashed the top glasses in two periscopes within half an hour one morning At present the division is resting and I and two friends have erected a wee bivouac under an apple tree on a farm It is quite cosy in fine weather but last night it was raining hard for several hours so we had to beat a hasty retreat to an old barn There is plenty of fruit about here but the water supply is very bad Last Sunday morning we enjoyed our first hot bath since our arrival here An old disused brewery has been turned into baths for troops also under clothing is washed and disinfected and kilts ironed there Fifty tubs are provided for washing in and two large vats filled with cold water to plunge into afterwards I have not got any stripes yet but have been studying signalling lately so expect soon to be in the signal section I must close now to get this letter away hoping Mr Taylor Mr Woodhams and yourself are keeping well and with kind regards to you all Yours very sincerely Frosty Dear Gerald Many thanks for letter which was somewhat a surprise to me No the news was quite fresh as I do not hear from anybody in the office We have just come from the trenches where we were for seven days and had a most awful time We were three days in the Reserve and put in the firing line where we took part in an attack and were also under a very heavy bombardment I am sorry to say we had many casualties thirty five killed and one hundred and thirty eight wounded and I can assure you it was an experience I shall never forget Anyhow Williams Kemball and myself came out quite safely I have seen Frost out here of course his battalion 8th Argyll  Sutherland Highlanders are in the same brigade also as a matter of fact they were in the firing line the night we came out I received a letter while I was in the trenches from Mr Slater Yes I heard about Chamberlain jolly sad was it not if you do hear from Dick James you might pass any news on to meShall be glad to hear from you I could write more only am a wee bit tired after seven days in trenches I am yours sincerely Fred HullPS Of course you know my address Remember me to all I know Dear BurgieWas very glad indeed to get your letters although your news in regard to Joe comes as a shock It was the first I had heard of him since he arrived in France in spite of the fact his regiment being quite close Am afraid the 9th and few days following were rotten days for a good many battalions our lot as much as any We have been in since the 8th and have had a fairly trying time we were reinforced during this week not before time as we were down to our last two hundred Cant tell how sorry I am to hear about Joe as you say he was one of the best I hope you chaps have not been annoyed at my not answering your very welcome letters I dont pride myself much on writing good yarns though and opportunities are also hard to find As you know I had a bit of a knock at Neuve Chappell but have quite got over that and am now in the best of health and spirits I came across Len Phillips and Peter Hawes in different drafts of the London Scottish while down at Rouen both of them have now had some experience on the job I expect Thank Mr Drewe very much for making inquiries tell him I occasionally wish heartily to be on the old job again the quiet life will do for me after this No I did not get Dicks magazine or letter expect it went astray while I was in hospital Thank him very much for sending them will you Had a game of football about two weeks ago with RGA Battery the pitch being a serious drawback I think it was a cabbage patch Still we managed to get a good game in and most important of all won The weather here has on the whole been very good just lately only getting an occasional days rain Last night we had a sharp thunderstorm a new experience it had at least the effect of shutting all the other disturbances of our rest up so we did not grouse Much obliged for all the information re the other fellows Am glad most of them are getting on so well Peacock seems to have come out top dog The job alone from other examples seems to be a paying one leaving out the holiday in Scotland Well must close my epistle Please remember me to Dick Mr Horsley Ransley and Drewe Fox Hoping both they and yourself are like myself OK Line censored From yours faithfully Dear Effie Very pleased to receive your letter like yourself I find my correspondence voluminous for me at times especially since I have taken on the duties of Platoon Sergeant which takes up more time than one realises at first We are still in the trenches and have been in action twenty four days consecutively and I dont know long we shall keep it up Had a dirty time yesterday morning dodging damned great bombs the blighters were presenting to us without exaggeration they were eighteen inches to a two feet long and made a hole about ten feet deep and fifteen feet diameter at least we did not wait to see them burst They can be seen descending through the air and then a scoot is made to get as far as possible round the corner the iron and dirt seem to be falling for a minute afterwards they are disturbing Dicky Gilson has not been with us the last twenty four days he broke his glasses and would not buy new ones went to the doctor and all that and worked the oracle and was left behind with the Transport dont know whether he worked the ticket properly and got a safer job farther back should not blame him if he has his nerves have been in a shocking state hed brood a lot as you know that is absolutely fatal when you have a dirty job on like this I have not seen either Frost or Kemball out here do not seem to meet anybody fresh as we are always in the same district and relieve the same crowds generally Our pals the French in my opinion scrap jolly well except in the isolated instances which are given undue prominence by our chaps by prejudice probably The casualties have certainly been enormous but a lot of them are a week old and one cannot form any opinion of what is going on by the lists and I should not be allowed to say what I thought of our doings lately Cronin is still with the 5th Bedfordshires and not out yet I think not likely to be in all probability Only wish we could repeat our swimming performance off Penarth specially the Wednesday evening ones Have heard rumours of leave being given shortly but do not rely much on it have been offered a Commission in this Battalion and I may take it up if my papers go through satisfactorily\\\\n\\\\nKindest regards and wishes to Mrs Lewis Your old Pal Dear Mr Hunt Many thanks for your long and interesting letter which I was very pleased to receive I am sorry I have been unable to answer it before but I have been constantly moving about from one place to another lately and have had no opportunity of writing letters Well I am very pleased to say I am feeling very fit and well and quite enjoying the life When writing to you last I was attached to the 4th Division and was stationed at a small village where we were living in tents We were stationed there about six weeks Just over a week ago I was transferred to another place about eighty miles from the other one I travelled by motor lorry with the Supply column and it took us all day from 730am till about 9 oclock in the evening to do the journey It was a glorious trip the scenery being very fine Almost as good as our office outing only not quite such comfortable travelling We put up for the night in a small village sleeping in the lorry with some empty petrol cans for a bed Next morning I was taken to the railhead where I was stationed until yesterday being only in that place just a week While there we were all still sleeping in tents but I was fortunate enough to have my meals with the Post Office Staff so have had a rest from being my own cook Yesterday afternoon just as I was going for my tea I was sent for and told to pack up my things and catch a train to another railhead as I had to take charge as the AMFO for three Divisions there As there is usually a man attached to each division this was rather a large order I only had about twenty miles or so to go but it took from 5 oclock till after 9pm to get there These French trains are very rapid I am now attached to the 51st Highland Division the same division as Williams a number of his lot were here today but he was not with them We shall probably only be here for a few days and will then move to another village further on I was very surprised to hear of Mr Pritchards death I also heard that Mr Crossley is also dead We are having glorious weather here at present and very hot at times Glad to hear you are having a soft time on the old section I was very pleased to hear about the collection of letters and photos from the troops that you are sending round the office and will certainly send you a photo later on I have has some taken but have not received them yet Have you heard from Ferdie or Gray at all We all had our photos taken at Longmoor before we came out here a group of six Unfortunately I only had a few copies and they have all been sent away Ferdie and Gray are still at the Base I believe but Arthur Smith is at one of the railheads somewhere Well I dont think I can tell you any more news at present Will write again later and send photo Kindest regards to all Yours sincerely Dear Bertie Just a few lines to let you know how I am getting on Am having the time of my life out here No doubt you have seen the several letters I have written to the office during the past few months so will not go into further details except to say that I have been exceedingly fortunate in seeing so much of India in a short time I shall never forget my trip through the Khyber Pass which has since been the scene of hard fighting one consequence of which we were hurriedly moved from Fyzabad to Rawalpindi in readiness to reinforce You would scarcely credit the feeling of disappointment that exists among the few British regular regiments left in India over not being ordered to France to take their share in the war The same feeling also exists in the Territorials A dragoon then left a few weeks ago to replace heavy casualties among the Norfolk regiment at the Gulf As the hot weather commenced the latter part of April and as many British troops as possible are always sent to the hills being almost unbearable on the plains we are fortunate enough to go and had a three days march and climb to this place 8000 feet up Well I never in any wild stretch of imagination ever dreamed that I should be soldiering in the Himalayan mountains Kuldana although 8000 feet up is on the lower Himalaya and from my bungalow which is situated on the edge of a steep precipice I can see lovely views which words fail to describe a perfect mixture of Devonshire Scotch and Alpine scenery Although seemingly only a few miles off the higher snow clad ranges in full view are from 100 to 150 miles away I have about 1½ miles trek to our Sergeants mess through beautiful scenery lovely wild rose bushes climbing up giant pink trees smothering them in roses maiden hair fern and all kinds of pretty flowers in the woods The climate is perfect lovely English summer weather with delightful mountain breezes The heat in India has not distressed me in the least not even on long arduous marches I am feeling splendidly fit and well and trust I shall continue so We have no end of gaiety all the married families of the Yorkshire regiment are living in our barracks under our charge as their regiments had to remain behind at Pindi and are being bitten to death almost with mosquitoes So we have Cinderella dances about three times a week whist drives racquet and tennis parties and have most enjoyable times I wish May and Eileen could take an aeroplane trip of a few hours and get to me it would be ripping for them I should be glad to hear that you had called to see them on your promised visit of months ago when I was home they would be awfully glad to see you both Do drop them a card old boy Fancy it is 10 months ago today since I left to go to camp what a lot has transpired since then I was in the 8th Middlesex 12 months ago and I see they have lost heavily in France funny I should have left them and joined the 6th East Surrey and to pass them at Gibraltar where they were first on my way to India On the whole I am enjoying life in India immensely I am acting Company Sergeant Major now and expect to be promoted to the rank shortly We are all Tommies now Trusting you are both fit and well Remember me to Stacey Yours sincerely Dear Mr Wheeler Just a few lines to let you know of my whereabouts This is our fifth Sunday at sea We left Southampton on Thursday October 29th shortly before midnight and our convoy of ten huge liners each with about 1700 to 2000 territorial troops on board assembled in the English Channel early next morning We were escorted by British warships as far as our first port of call Malta the French warships to Port Said After staying one night there we proceeded through the Suez Canal We lay off the Port of Suez six days waiting for another escort then on through the Red Sea to Aden where we stayed four days waiting for our Japanese escort When it arrived it brought with it an immense convoy of over 80 huge liners transports filled with New Zealand and Indian troops This in addition to a convoy of thirty five vessels that came into Suez whilst we lay there So it may truly be sung that Britannia rules the waves It has been a most delightful and interesting voyage and the weather is now so hot that hundreds of troops are compelled to sleep on deck nightly as the heat is much too great below We landed two cases of fever at Aden Fortunately it does not appear to have spread any further so far We expect to reach Bombay on Wednesday next December 2nd then three or four days train journey to Fyzabad some distance north of Lucknow Shall be very glad to get there as five weeks on board a crowded troop ship with very little opportunity for exercise is getting rather irksome especially when we get no Daily Paper only a little wireless war news occasionally I am glad to say that I am wonderfully fit and well Our food has been wholesome and plentiful Trusting you are well with my best wishes for as Happy a Christmas as is possible under prevailing war conditions and a Prosperous New Year in due course Also please convey same to Messrs Wood Welsh Davis and others Hoping to see you again on the termination of our successful conclusion of the war Believe me yours faithfully H Beaumont Will you also convey my respects to Mr Price please Dear Arthur I expect you are wondering why I have not written but it is an awful effort to get all correspondence off and be on active service at the same time I cant say that I am enjoying myself out here Its awfully hot and we are eaten up by millions of flies Life in the trenches is not a picnic either we have about four or five days out of them and eight or nine in them When we are out supposed to be resting we have to go on working parties digging etc then wherever we are we are always under shell fire so its not much rest after all The last shell we had in camp there was four killed and seventeen wounded We have been under fire for three months now and we should like a rest as the strain is tremendous on ones nerves I dont think the troops in France get it quite as bad Then again the only comforts we have are sent from home as the country here is quite barren and we cannot buy anything in shops I would give a quid for a pint of beer down the club Our food consists of half a loaf of bread per day bacon and tea for breakfast Bully beef and biscuits for dinner and Jam for tea and cheese Lime juice is served out about four times per week that is a drop is put into a dixie of water and a cup full served out per man and rum is served out twice a week sometimes that is about four table spoonful each We live in a trench and it is a mercy it dont rain otherwise wed be washed away The fighting just lately has been terrible Our shells knock the enemy all ways and the sight in the trenches that we take is awful We wear our respirators because of the awful smell of the dead Ill never get the sight out of my eyes and it will be an everlasting nightmare If I am spared to come home Ill be able to tell you all about it but I cannot possibly write as words fail me I cant describe things Wouldnt it be nice to be at Walmer again and you come down and see me again I did enjoy that time and also seeing Billy Dawson and Richardson There seem to be a lot of French troops out here but there seems to be no relief for us Nobody loves us now Churchill has gone we are nobodys pets Its the army first here except when there is work to be done and then the Naval Division have to do it You know both my brothers have commissions in the 4th Bedfordshires and are at Dovercourt My wife tells me she has sent me three boxes of stuff I received one box and I fear that one transport has been floundered sunk and another has been torpedoed so I expect that is where my other two boxes are Its awfully disappointing because I do look forward so to a bit of chocolate and a few biscuits from home We get cigarettes and baccy served out to us but it is too hot to smoke much so that I dont miss that so much I get a bath in a biscuit tin when I can but when in the trenches I have to go all the time without a wash so you can tell I am used to being dirty How are they all down the club and is Emmie still there and is she better or not Is Paice going to Looe this year And where are you spending your holidays Lord how Id like a holiday I am so tired and would give anything to get away from this continual banging Please remember me to all fellows who are left in the office Mr Miller and Goff  Hills and George Williams and all the boys generally I cant write to all separately also for details of my experiences you must wait until I get back if ever I do of which sometimes I despair The papers tell you pretty full accounts although they are rather anticipating events as to our advancing Now I must close old chap and thank you very much for all your kindness Wishing you all the best Dear BertieMany thanks for letters and fags both were very acceptable as you can imagine for it bucks one up to hear from old associates I also had a letter from Tinker Taylor who told me Gwen has left the Great Western Railway Company I will write to Ferdi Ferdinand and ask Frosty if you give me his address I can imagine how lovely and empty the old room looks fancy more flappers eh quite a selection as you say I will just give you an idea of our work here day by day Reveille 600am stables at 630730 breakfast till 9 Then exercise ride one and lead two or three horses for one and a half hours then groom them until 1215 then we water and feed and go to dinner till 230 then sweep up  down at 4pm then water and feed at 415 to 430 and hay up at 5pm only we take it in turns to do that and we have stables like this Fatty has drawn a rough sketch of the stables which house the horses We have six and seven a side which leaves us four horses each Of course sandwiched between this is probably a visit to Avonmouth Docks to fetch horses or take ours to the station for we only keep them for a week at the time just to knock the mud off and feed them up so as they get their shore legs and look a bit shipshape again We have about 10000 a week come in of horses and mules and some of them are fair devils so wild and timidI may come and see you probably Saturday if I get the weekend off  Dear ErnieThanks very much for your letter and kind wishes My wounds are getting on all right and they have discovered eleven in all It is hard not to be able to get up but I suppose a month will soon be slip by My people came to see me yesterday and the day beforeYou ought to see my face They cannot shave me because I have scraps of shell sticking in and as I had not had a shave for about a week before I was wounded I look a pretty pictureWell old chap I am glad I am wounded to get out of that hell and if you ever meet a chap that says he wants to go back call him a liarIf you could manage to come down at any time I should be delighted I have not received any letter from Dalton but perhaps will get it later That will be the time old chap when I look into the office on my way home Well manage to get a drink then  Well I must close now and I expect you will have quite enough trouble to read what I have written already Hoping to be with you allYour old pal Rip Dear SirI have now been out in France a fortnight I am getting on quite well in the army Food is also good and plentiful Of course I find the life much rougher from that which I have been used to but it is a fine experience all the sameWe were at Longmoor camp for a week where we were equipped and put through elementary drills We slept in a big hut there and had a sack of straw and three blankets each The huts of which ours was one were called Apple Pie and they are about a mile from the camp so we had to be up about six every morning in order to march down for parade at the camp The parade was at 715am Some mornings we had an hours drill before breakfast It was about 11pm I should think when we arrived at Longmoor on 31st March and consequently we went straight to our hut No light was provided so we had to fish about for our beds in the dark Fortunately it was moonlight and after some time a lantern was brought We were only too glad when getting up time came the next morning It was before six We were marched down to the camp and were inspected by the Sergeant Major and after waiting some time went into breakfast Roast sausage was the chief item on the menu but to our amazement no knives and forks were supplied for usWell the only thing was to convey the sausages to our mouths with fingersThe nearest thing to a knife and fork that some had was a pair of nail scissors so these were used Personally I did not know whether to feel shocked or to laugh at the situation it ended in the latter We Audit fellows got to one table and we had to have a good laugh before we could eat much It was a hopeless situation to be in Dont let this discourage anyone from coming but I warn him to bring a knife and fork with him After the first day we were issued with kits and we treasure our knives and forks now We came across on the mail boat Hantonia from Southampton to Havre  We had to sleep in huts there on the docks but the sleeping accommodation was better We Audit fellows were able to keep together till last Saturday night when Pond and I were sent off to different railheads He is at 3rd Corps Railhead We had to travel in horseboxes and during night time We travelled in this manner Saturday Sunday and Monday nights French shunting is severe and we were shaken up Saturday and Sunday we were about 30 in the trucks Monday 17 We were fortunate enough to get out into every town at which we stopped during the day On Tuesday night another young fellow and I were stranded at a station somewhere in France and we were instructed by the military authorities to sleep in the goods shed We had to sleep on the deck of the shed and shunting was going on during the night This was about the limit I thought I arrived finally at my destination about midday last Wednesday Now I live in a truck at a small French station There are two other Sappers and a Lieutenant here We deal chiefly with gifts and comforts sent to the troopsWe are out in the country I think this railhead is about seven miles from the firing line Can hear the guns and see the star shells at night I must ask you kindly to excuse me for writing in pencil because I have no pen and ink here Would you mind letting this letter be treated as to the whole of the statistical department please sir With kindest regards to all I am yours obediently My dear MotherI Have just come through a particularly nasty period We went into the trenches on Wednesday night and on Sunday morning at 5am our Artillery commenced bombarding the German trenches and after 20 minutes had elapsed we went over the parapet My goodness what a reception the Huns had in store for us they simply swept the ground with machine gun fire and shrapnel Poor old C coy caught it hot and Neuve Chapelle seemed to be a fleabite compared with this It was found impossible to make any advance in our quarter so I dug myself in and awaited events It was horrible suspense as I seemed to be the only man untouched all around me and being personally acquainted with each man made matters worse in fact its all wrong to call them men as they were mostly mere boys About early afternoon I was hailed from the trench as to whether it was possible for me to get back I replied in the affirmative and decided to run the risk of getting potted on the way So I commenced crawling on my stomach until about a few yards from the parapet then made a spring and rushed headlong over the top nearly spoiling the features of a few who happened to be in the trench and were not expecting me We were relieved that afternoon but some of the fellows did not get in until nightfall and these experienced another bombardment Billy Hastings is quite fit and the only pal left We have been resting since and getting information about the illegible but by all reports we shall be up again soon No rest for the wicked it is said and if true we must surely be a bad lot\\\\n\\\\nWhat a terrible thing about the Lusitania and with so many Americans aboard Should imagine there will be more trouble Have received box and letter dated 6th and am most thankful for everything you are all doing for me censored As regards the pads masks of cotton pads which served as gas masks all we were served out with were made on the spot and consisted of a piece of gauze and tape and were steeped in a solution of bicarbonate of soda prior to this charge I lost all my belongings except the Gillette razor so should be glad of a few toilet requisites when next you are sending a parcel Do not trouble about towel and perhaps Frank would get me a shaving brush Must now close Much love to all From your affectionate son I am much nearer the front now and we moved here last Tuesday It was a long march and of course done at night and our present billet is a farm or the remains of one in a large village about ¾ mile from the trenches more north than we were before and nearer the Belgian frontier It is an awfully desolate spot and constantly under shell fire This morning I was trying to get a sleep on the grass when a shell burst in a tree not fifty yards away and sent a shower of leaves to the ground Fortunately no one was hit another burst in the same field ten minutes afterwards then I thought it was time to shift So went into a barn There are a number of dugouts around but they are so cold and you might get buried inside The farm is a vile place with a lot of stagnant water around and a lot of German soldiers are buried here The barn where we sleep would be improved if a shell struck the roof and ventilated it in our absence As the smell inside is bad and makes it nearly necessary to wear a respirator The rats seem to object to our company as they often have a free fight on top of usLast night was my first experience in the trenches and we returned to billet this morning The din is simply awful and just lately the big guns have been giving the enemy beans every night I am glad to say we had no casualties although the rifle fire was heard at times especially on our left where the Germans made an attack on the Indian troops The British gun fire was simply terrific all night and the Germans did not reply very much It was fine to watch the flashes of our guns at our backs although the screaming of the shells overhead is at first rather scaring to say the least of it\\\\n\\\\nHowever the news we hear from day to day at this part of the front is very cheerful and encouraging Yesterday I came across an Indian soldier who could speak English very well and he thought another month would see the war over also a German officer captured near here said it could not go on very much longer I for one hope these remarks will prove correctThe church here is practically demolished just some of the walls and tower standing and the churchyard is in a bad state Great holes have been made and bones exposed In these holes is water sufficiently deep to drown anybody Great stone vaults have been opened and coffins and bodies can be seen Of course the place here is not inhabited except by soldiers I have been through some of the big houses and plenty of good carved furniture pictures fittings etc still remain in them I also have been in some of the gardens and roses just coming into bloom can be seen in great numbers I should like to see them at home Well I must close now and hope you are all keeping well Again thanking you all for our good wishes Sincerely yours S Frost Dear Nic First of all I must thank you and the others who sent me their kind letters of sympathy in regard to my brother Sam We all felt it very much at home and it was a great shock to our parents naturally but it cant be helped as he was killed in a good cause I suppose you have heard how we left Bedford early on Sunday 18715 and had a lovely trip down the old firm to Keyham we were well laden and I was glad to get aboard and get to my berth in which I am very comfortable with two other Warrant Officers The men and Sergeants are on the troop deck and none too comfortable but are jogging along alright now The first part of the voyage the sea was very quiet we passed Gibraltar in a fog at night so couldnt see it We then skirted the coast of Algeria and had a pleasant run to Malta where we stopped a full day The higher officials went ashore for a few hours including myself and had a good time I cannot mention troops or ships so refrain from doing so but there was a hell of a lot Our next stop was Alexandria for three days where we had another look round including a route march for the Battalion The sea is fairly rough at this end rather surprising but a lovely colour light blue at day and dark at night All lights out at 800 perfect darkness there is no twilight to speak of being dark at 730pm\\\\n\\\\nWe then wondered where we were off to but eventually reached Port Said stopped a day went ashore and off we go to the Dardanelles which we expect to reach tonight Our kits have been left behind in Egypt and all we have got we stand in We are now passing through the Aegean sea full of rocky islands very much like the highlands of Scotland Bullen has just lost his helmet over the side but is otherwise wellI am in the best of health at present and hope to go through alright I expect you heard I got married a week before I left a lot of us did the same thing it was quite a common occurrence Our old boat is a captured German liner and is full up but we have got a Greek crew with a few Portuguese thrown in and so are a mixed lot especially with Welsh men aboard How are things going at the office I have been away nearly a year I shall be glad to hear from you now and again just to keep in touch I must close now as they say a mail is being collected before we land Yours sincerely Dear Burgie Thanks awfully for your letter glad to hear that you are all serene and that the GWR is still flourishing without me as a matter of fact I expect its better without me but still there you are By Jove I had no idea that the Audit had shoved so many fellows into khaki its fine Well the old Brigade has had some pretty varied experiences in this land of stinks and bad beer We landed at Havre last March and after a freezing night under canvas on the heights behind the town we had a rather weird train journey up country There were about 10 of us per cattle truck with a few wisps of straw to sleep on Our horses were boxed six in a truck three with their heads facing the engine and three facing the rear of the train Two men sat on corn sacks between their bottoms If they kept the shutters closed they had a beautiful journey as it was so warm with the horsesAt about 2am the old caboodle pulled up and we thought we were in for a dreary hang about however the order came down to bring out the dixies and fall in for something hot I took our one up and the liquid smelt so good that with a little judicious wangling we managed to get another one full When we tasted it it was simply gorgeous Boiling hot coffee and rum as only Frenchmen can make it you know how Gee but it did go down a treat\\\\n\\\\nWell after many jolts and bumps we arrived at our destination It was miles from the firing line and a fearful hole at that At nine next morning we were off again and went up further still riding about 23 miles before we came to anchor at a rather dirty mining villageAfter about three weeks in this show we shunted up and got our baptism Its a funny sensation being under fire for the first time but it soon wears off One gets a rather nasty jolt when the first casualty occurs especially as it was in our case the finest fellow we had on the staff He got a chunk of shell in the back of his neck and was killed on the spot We were in action at this place for about two months and took part in several bombardments one of them being the one in which poor old Joey was killed We had some pretty rough times but were very fortunate as regards casualties Two months action and 2½ days rest it doesnt seem much but thats what we got and then at it again in a different part This show had been occupied by the Germs and then by the French from whom we took over The filth and stench was too awful for words one of our batteries striking rather unlucky in coming across Germs buried just under the surface when they started digging their guns in The air was blue for milesThe next action we had was a hell of a show The staff were put into a huge Chateau which was under observation and fire from three sides And they didnt half sling the lead about too Its marvellous that we didnt get lifted skywards heaps of times but still here we are After a good spell in this show we came to rest again about 10 days or so ago We are having a good time here in the way of concerts sports boxing tournaments etc The latter was great especially the bout between a Farrier Sergeant and a cooks mate They biffed at one another until neither could stand it was awfully funny Little Seedy Ellis has got a snip job at a base He came up today with a draught of men He is having the time of his life and looks it by the dark circles under his eyesI am feeling wonderfully fit and well and would not have missed coming out for quids I suppose you saw in the paper that two of our boys have got the Distinguished Conduct Medal They were in Major Lord Gorells Battery he is awfully bucked about it Well old man I must dry up I hope you can read this disgusting scrawl but will make that whiskered excuse active service conditions Please remember me to all the boys and tell Long Liz that I would give anything for a barrel or two of the club bitter  Dear Mr Rogers Just a few lines to let you know I am still alive and have up to now succeeded in dodging those small pieces of lead which have been so frequently flying about the Peninsular Dardanelles I expect you are wondering how I got here also why Con convalescent Camp I will try and tell you briefly what happened since our leaving Egypt We left Alexandria 13th August and landed at the new landing at Sulva Bay on the 18th under shell fire Not a very nice kick off Our first engagement was on the 21st when we took part in the big fight for Hill 70 and 971 I expect you read about it in the papers for I see the Daily Sketch had a page full of it They spoke of us as the Irresistable Yeomanry very glowing words of our charge also It was a very stiff go and we were fighting from 3pm the 21st until dark on the 22nd and never stopped advancing and retiring the whole time We had the Hill on the night of the 21st but could not hold it because no support was sent up so the Yeomanry those of us who were left had to retire at night after charging and capturing three lines of Turkish trenches Our Brigade Berkshire Buckinghamshire and Dorset Yeomanry was ordered to do the charging for the Division and I think we did fairly well from what the General said in his report Of course we suffered pretty heavy After five days on the Peninsular we did not have an Officer left in our regiment and only barely half the men I have seen a few of our Officers in the casualty list but no men I was very pleased to get the GRW Magazine while resting in dugouts on Chocolate Hill I hope no more of the Audit boys have fallen since the last I saw I suppose you are still pretty slack in the office I find Ive run away from the tale but here in the YMCA tent it is so crowded and the piano on the go it is rather difficult to write After resting from the big fight three days we went into the trenches for spells of five days on one case seven days After five weeks I caught dysentery and had to come away I was put on a hospital ship and brought to St Patricks Hospital Malta During those five weeks I was pretty lucky The only close bullet was one through my right sleeve and grazing my arm We all have some very narrow shaves from shrapnel I had the sandbags of my dugout knocked down one day but fortunately I was down to get water Probably if I had been inside I would have caught it properly I expect to be here about a fortnight to three weeks before I go back I am hoping the boys will be across before that and the Turkish army cut in two I suppose the office still looks more empty than it ever did How is Mr Jackson getting on in France I see his regiment has been in action I have often wondered how he would get on in trench warfare I suppose McConnel is still going strong Will not stop for more now as I shall lose the mail Kind regards to Mr Cox and all the men on the section Hope you are still enjoying the best of health and still dodging the bombs Hope to write again soon Yours truly Dear Effie You were doubtless surprised to get a postcard from up here dont know why they sent us such a long way north it is alright but I think London would have suited me better could have seen my pals sometimes I am not allowed to get out of bed yet tried the other night and fell down in a fit serves me right for disobeying orders I have the piece of shell which fractured my skull and shall look after it for a souvenir The doctors say I was very lucky not to have been put right out It was a heavy piece British would not have been wounded by anything less We were in an advanced post sticking beyond our front line called the Ducks Bill and naturally pretty close to the German trenches In fact they surrounded us I hear from Bedford that the company has been told to prepare for the Dardanelles I dont know where he is though have heard nothing from him We are having a concert with our ward this afternoon and we have plenty of visitors in every afternoon some very fair women taking them generally and very decent too treat everybody alike Remember me kindly to Mrs Lewis I shall make a more determined attempt to see you if I get a sick leave which is most probable Well have no more news at present How about taking up a post in your department when this lot is over it would suit me to have headquarters in London for a time mustnt count chickens though Goodbye Old boy Dear Mr Hunt Thanks for the cigarettes and magazine all very much appreciated and I want to confess something I am terribly short of cigarettes just now Dont know how to get on So you had Peter Jackson up to see you a short time ago Lord how I wish I could get up to London Some of our chaps have leave but this advance seems to have put a stop to it Thats the only reason I am sorry for the long awaited advance God knows it was really time we did do something if only to relieve the pressure on Eastern front We are in this part of the line and are still sitting tight worse luck I wish they would get a move on here as well It has cost us a good many casualties but I think the Germans what with the bombardment they got and the counter attacks they delivered must have lost many more than us I have got an interesting souvenir It is part of the framework of a German aeroplane the fourth which our airmen have recently brought down in this neighbourhood The machine gun in one of our planes had killed the German pilot and the machine getting out of control exploded or at least the engine did and the whole aircraft crashed to earth God it was an awful mess Both the pilot and observer were killed the former being bashed out recognition but the latter survived the fall but died shortly afterwards Our airmen seem to be the masters of the Germans now although the taubes seem to be the faster machines our men seem to have much spirit and initiative About a fortnight ago I saw a fleet of fourteen of our planes cross over our lines on a raiding expedition They were in close formation and the Germans sent up a rain of shells without doing any damage The raid was very successful I believe two transport trains full of German reinforcements being wrecked a large station destroyed Well thats about all from me let me hear from you soon How is everybody up there Best regards to all the section Dear Dada Many thanks for the Slough paper and magazines Was very sorry to see that Jefferies and How have lost their lives I heard from Arthur this morning and he tells me that Fred Blane has died of wounds in the Dardanelles I expect you remember him in the Windsor Operatic Society Harold White Ginger who lived with Arthur has joined the Royal Artillery Garrison and is now at Plymouth Arthur has sold the motorbike Petrol is too expensive he says Since I wrote last I have been moved to a little village about 2½ miles out of the town I was in then It is a dead and alive hole with only a few houses and two cafes only one of which is open The other has had all the windows blown out We expect to move further on still in a day or two We have changed our truck for a much larger one and have made ourselves very comfortable It is about 30 feet long so we have divided it off with our ground sheets for curtains at one end to make a bedroom and the rest of the truck we have fitted up with desks and cupboards I spent the other evening making a table out of bacon boxes etc At present we are living very well indeed with bacon and kidneys for breakfast steaks and vegetables for dinner jam and honey etc for tea and bread and cheese and pickles for supper Not bad for active service The Post Office cook still does all our cooking There are four of us on the staff here now One attached to each of the three divisions and one learning the work who will probably leave soon to take charge of a division There have been plenty of aeroplanes over here lately A German came over the other evening and our people shelled it for about half an hour I dont know whether it was brought down or not I had a nice long letter from Mr Hunt yesterday He sent me photo of the Roll of Honour and told me all the latest Audit office news Well I dont think I have much more to tell you at present so will conclude with love to all Dear Bert Many thanks for your letter received a few days ago also for the good old Woodbines which I got today While I think of it in your letter you refer to a report published in the 6th monthly Magazine for August 15 will you send me a copy as I have not seen it Well we have had about the biggest gruelling we could wish for The Huns bombarded us in the trenches for over two hours with Jack Johnson shells shrapnel whizz bangs terrible things and trench mortars blew the parapets to blazes and nearly blew the whole lot of us up The General Officer Commanding has complimented us on our behaviour We are now resting at a place called Vlamertinghe just south of Ypres and a couple miles North of Poperinghe Poperinge in Belgium We deserve a rest for we have spent thirtynine days in dugouts and the trenches except three days and needless to tell you we are very crummy which tends to spoil the rest we are having I never thought I was going to another phase of them after South Africa I was in Poperinghe where I met Jackson a few weeks agoThe beauty of it out here is we can stand a pal a drink and also have one with him I suppose shall have to wait for my increase being an absentee from the office anyway they can add it on to my salary as soon as they like for I shall then be able to pay more income tax I enclose a few postcards They are showing in each card before and after or during and after the bombardment of Ypres so you can guess what the place looks like Well Bert in conclusion I must tell you that one of our Sergeants who is on leave posted this in London for me thats why I am able to give you a few details Kind regards to all friends in the Audit Dear Mr Jones\\\\n\\\\nJust a line to let you know that Im still alive and am moving to Kings Lynn on Wednesday next Will write you later How do you like the photo Best regards to the office From\\\\n\\\\nH Giles Dear Father I do hope you and mother have not been worrying much about me as I am getting on all right My wound is well now and the broken bone is my only trouble  the two ends took the wrong turning first time so a couple of days ago they put them on the right road again I ought not to be left with a short leg as there is about 40lb weight on the end of it in fact I should not be surprised if it finishes off ahead of the other One good thing is I get very little pain except when I am moved Did you get my postcard I havent had an answer yet but expect letters take a long while I believe I asked you to send me some fruit but as things take such a long while to get here I am afraid it would be bad besides they take French money here and as I drew 5 from the Field Cashier only a few days before I was wounded I am quite well off and the orderly will buy fruit for me in the town I expect you are surprised to get a letter when I said on the post card that I should only be allowed to write once from this hospital but a fresh order has come out and one letter a month is allowed Well I have written quite enough about myself I think I am longing to get a letter from you and mother it seems ages since I heard from you Have you taken a house in Uxbridge yet or are you waiting until Auntie and Uncle move there I do hope you are getting a little more used to the lonely house Please remember me to everybody and give my love to all relations next time you write and tell them I should like to hear from them if they would write although I shant be able to answer their letters Have you heard how Frank is getting on I meant to write him but put it off too long I expect my kit has been sent home hasnt it I am afraid your field glasses are lost as I left my equipment in the wood when I was hit I am awfully sorry if they are but perhaps one of the men picked them up I arrived here with only one boot and only one puttee so will you send me a pair of puttees and a tie out of my kit I shall be supplied with boots when I leave here which wont be for a while I expect One thing I shall be very glad to get will be some books We are very well treated here and the Belgian sisters from the convent are very good and often bring us grapes or apples I didnt get a very long run for my money did I It is rotten being out of the show not that I wanted the war to last long far from it but while it was on I liked to have a finger in the pie but it is no good grumbling and the best thing to do is to hope it will soon be over so that I can soon be home with you both again Please give my kind regards to Kate Very best love to you both Cheer up and dont worry about me Your loving son 2nd Lieutenant Mayo\\\\n\\\\nCharlie PS I hope you can read this it is awkward writing lying down Several months ago when we relieved the French of these trenches it was noticed how quiet the atmosphere was and it seemed quite in keeping with the beautiful hilly scenery Since the British occupation however things here have livened up considerably and it has been found necessary to greatly strengthen the trenches and make dugouts much deeper and safer because of the various kinds of souvenirs sent over from the enemy Their latest was the aerial mine of which no doubt you have read It is exactly like an oil drum to look at with wood ends and explodes with a terrific report I dont think it can be fired from a gun as it comes tumbling across in such an awkward manner I dont think we manufacture these articles at Woolwich as we can afford decent shells We are not troubled very much by German artillery but they make up for that with trench mortars and rifle grenades As a signaller I escape some of the hardships of trench life especially now the winter has arrived and much prefer duties which keep one under shelter to those of exposure at the parapet Of course we have exciting times when any wires are cut by trench mortars etc and which need to be repaired at once wherever the break is Just lately I am having a lot of experience at making and fitting fireplaces in dugouts We generally use biscuit tins to hold the fire and rummage among old houses in the village nearby for pieces of piping to take the smoke out usually through the entrance as it is impossible to cut a hole through the roof on account of the sheet of iron Fuel for burning is generally a problem but a small supply of coke is allowed and we add to it all kinds of wood etc When sitting up at night it is surprising what good time we keep when waking up the next fellow to carry on if there is no fire but if a good fire is on we get quite generous and dont mind allowing the next man an extra hour or so to sleep\\\\n\\\\nWe have had several days of rain this week which doesnt tend to improve life in the trenches or out On our journey to billets last Saturday night we took a road through a wood constructed by the Royal Engineers It wasnt quite finished and in places was ankle deep in water so our march was more of a paddle Parts of this wood which is in a valley had been purposely flooded so the road had to be laid on faggots and will be a piece of work when finished We are fortunate in having dry billets with beds raised above the floor and a small fire Sheep skin coats have been issued to us and are very warm There is a fellow here now imitating a monkey and holding out a small cup to an audience seated on the beds while another chap is playing an accordion All we need now are top boots tall rubber waders or gum boots designed to try and avoid the problem of trench foot to paddle through the trenches There is plenty of water about but very little to drink or wash in It is a fine place for people who are good at finding excuses for not washing But there are very good hot water baths here only it isnt any good having a bath unless one really needs it on account of the colour of the water We do very well though for food and clothing both of which are good and well supplied and considering the many distant places it is sent from it speaks well of the splendid way our Navy is doing its bit Dear Arthur\\\\n\\\\nI really must make this effort to write to you and let you know how I am progressing Well so far as a little internal trouble Im keeping fairly fit now that the cold weather has started and on my present job I can doctor myself I am prepared to stick this campaign until further orders\\\\n\\\\nWe are now in our winter quarters and a very nice place it is Right on the edge of the cliffs with a beautiful sea below it reminds me very much of Cornwall Then just across is the island of Imbros and the sunlight on those mountains is sometimes marvellous On a quiet warm day with the birds singing one wonders if there is a war on but the blooming shells soon drive that idea away Its jolly cold now though but we have been served out with nice thick underclothes and waterproofs and top boots and except for always living in the ground our comforts have been looked after as far as possible Our food is as good as anyone could want also Im now used to a lot that before Id turn my nose up at and so long as the ships can land the goods I dont think we shall be so badly off\\\\n\\\\nMind it does blow and the sea gets awfully rough and then no ships can come near us We have the sea on three sides and the Turks on the fourth so we are truly between the devil and the deep sea The Turks still find some ammunition from somewhere whether our guns and the warships knock the very dickens out of them Its very exciting to watch a battle especially now its on our side the guns are not like at Antwerp where we were the ones potted Now I am too sleepy to continue and as the firing has quieted down Im going to sleep and continue tomorrow\\\\n\\\\n51215 Ive not had a chance to finish this letter before so here goes Weve had snow and rain and thunder and such lightening and Lord it has been cold everything frozen and even the water in my water bottle But today has been beautifully mild and calm almost like summer again I have just received a packet of letters from my wife written at different times since May so am still in hopes that there may be some more back dates knocking around the world for me We had three men killed last night in a little spasm and today our guns and the Turks have been flinging dirt at each other We used to duck once upon a time as the shells came over but now everyone seems curious to see what sort of a burst it will be and how much dust is knocked up and heaps have cameras taking photos\\\\n\\\\nEnclosed is a bit of heather which grows in great profusion all over the peninsular And the troops use in the trenches to boil their dixies on And now about the office Do you know but its quite an effort to remember the routine now\\\\n\\\\nI suppose Mr Millow is still with you and is there any chance of HRH Goff joining say as a SC probably Senior Clerk There is now a singing in the air and bang just as I write theyve dropped one over to us Sometimes a shell bursts and when we are working at something we dont even know its come along Its funny what you can get used But to get back to the office I expect you have heaps of ladies there now lord I havent seen a woman since April What do they look like I expect they scent out the office and how careful you all must be not to swear We often laugh here at the thought that if ever we do return to civil life again well be digging a little hole in the garden to live in and stirring up our tea with a bit of stick or our finger and just spit on the floor when smoking and if a little tickling in our shirt just hopping it off in the street\\\\n\\\\nI am out of paper he is writing this on envelope but it dont matter How are the lambs going Heres one thats doing a little doing a little bleat far from home Id like to come you know and have a rub at a bed and a roof also a drop of beer perchance Living in a hole for seven months now and the blue sky above gets a bit monotonous at times especially when the dirt will persist in falling on your face when you are trying to sleep and when it rains youre up to your knees in no time and thats always at night We had rum served out tonight and do you know I cant bear the stuff just pause and think by the wayside I cant drink rum in fact I hate it How we do change by time Now how is everyone down the club Remember me to Emmie and Mrs Fellows and May I understand that Mr Welsh and Mr Davies have been awfully kind to my wife and I reckon its jolly good of them This war seems to have found me so many kind friends I dont know what Ill do to repay them all if I live through this\\\\n\\\\nWhat has become of Beaumont and Jackson and is my pal Jimmy Edwards still alive Bert Id like to send you a Turkish shell but the post office wont accept them for transit anyhow perhaps Ill bring home a nose fuse for a paper weight Do you know back in the summer I had a shell drop just off the seat of my trousers and it did not explode Kaw It was a bit of luck I didnt stop to pick him up though in case he changed his mind later Well now Ive tried to remember everyone but do you give heartiest good wishes to the office for a Merry Xmas and a victorious New Year and trusting youll all be safe from Zeppelins Yours very sincerely\\\\n\\\\nT Harold Watts The last time I wrote I think I told you we had lost our comfortable job on\\\\nrailheads We have been shifted from General Headquarters and are at\\\\nthe most godforsaken hole there can possibly be in France We had a\\\\nrotten journey raining all the time Reveille was at 4am and we\\\\neventually

We appear to be much better\\\\noff in this respect than before and certainly think that D Co has got as\\\\ngood a selection of officers as any other company in the battalion One of\\\\nour fellows ran across a number of Audit REs and they enquired after\\\\nMaggs and myself\\\\nFreddy or\\\\nWhats left of him after some very stiff marching Dear Mr Hunt\\\\nI expect you have heard at the office about me being in England suffering\\\\nfrom gas poisoning and as it is quite a long time since I last wrote to\\\\nyou no doubt a few lines will be acceptable to explain matters\\\\nWe left the trenches at Vimy Ridge on July 5th and marching back about\\\\n14 miles we eventually reached a village named Ostreville for the purpose\\\\nof having a divisional rest The signallers thought an orchard would be\\\\nvery convenient to erect bivouacs in so when we were busy carrying out\\\\nthis idea an old Frenchman appeared at the scene and raised objections\\\\nHowever he agreed at last to allow us in at one end of the orchard\\\\nthinking I suppose that we would wander about his place We had an\\\\nenjoyable time here for six days and then had to return to our old billets\\\\nnear Mount St Eloi until the whole of the division had retired We guessed\\\\nby this move that our rest was over and the following days were spent\\\\nin marching and travelling by motor lorries and train until we arrived at\\\\nMericourt Station on July 21st near Albert\\\\nAfter a delightful swim in the river near the billet we marched off the\\\\nfollowing night to take part in the big push We slept in an open field\\\\nthat night near Fricourt farm and were rather rudely awakened by a few\\\\nGerman shells landing near us\\\\nFor five days we were lying in reserve in this district and occupied our\\\\ntime in watching an army of men at work in the valley making roads\\\\nrailways boring for water and laying down water pipes also practicing\\\\nattacks in the old trenches It was very interesting to see the great\\\\namount of artillery busy practically all day and night and to read their\\\\nmessages sent by visual signalling often using lights from a ridge across\\\\nthe valley\\\\nOur period in reserve being up we moved to Mametz Wood to lie there in\\\\nsupport for five days before going into the trenches at High Wood On\\\\narrival at the edge of the wood at night we were welcomed by a big dose\\\\nof gas shells and shrapnel which was applied steadily throughout the\\\\nnight by the German artillery Having to assist in putting our signalling\\\\ngear into a hole for safety I was prevented from using my respirator for\\\\nthe first quarter of an hour as we could not see on account of the\\\\ndarkness and dust made by the ammunition columns rushing along the\\\\nroad and it was during this time that I must have breathed in enough gas\\\\nto put me out of action Afterwards of course respirators were used when\\\\nwe were settled in holes by the roadside for the night\\\\nI remained with the battalion until I was sent to the casualty clearing\\\\nstation on August 3rd and reached Rouen hospital the next day I had to\\\\nwait until the 9th and crossed the channel from Havre to Southampton on\\\\nthe New Zealand ship Marama with about 800 other patients the day\\\\nafter It was a splendid boat with every convenience for carrying wounded\\\\nmen and the sisters and orderlies were colonials\\\\nIt was last Friday week when I arrived here and must say it is very\\\\ncomfortable and quiet I had to remain in bed until last Saturday but of\\\\ncourse I cannot do any route marching yet So I have to take life quietly\\\\nwhich is no hardship I can assure you after France I am on an ordinary\\\\ndiet and taking medicine\\\\nI hear you have Mr Symons back again is that so And is he back in the\\\\nsame old spot I hope he is pretty fit although I suppose there must be\\\\nsomething wrong with him to be back again\\\\nI suppose things are as quiet as usual with you Have you had your\\\\nholidays yet This is about your time I believe I shall be glad of a few\\\\nlines when you have time to hear the latest about the office I hope you\\\\nare keeping fit also Mr JB Taylor and Mr Woodhams and with kind\\\\nregards to you all Yours sincerely\\\\nFrosty\\\\nPS It is a treat to write a letter without the censors shadow over one Dear Mr Hunt\\\\nThanks very much for your letter which I received a week or two ago also\\\\nfor the magazine\\\\nWe are in the trenches just now In fact we seem to spend about three\\\\ntimes as much time in as we do out Also we are in a pretty warm spot it\\\\nwas about here towards the end of last summer that the French and\\\\nGerman had some of the fiercest fighting of the war The country around\\\\nabout is a veritable maze of trenches The fighting at one time was so\\\\nfierce that there was only time just to bury the dead in the sides of the\\\\ntrenches and now that the trenches have crumpled one is constantly\\\\nseeing the bones of mens legs or their boots or skulls sticking out from\\\\nthe sides of the trenches pleasant eh There will be a pleasant smell\\\\nhere in the summer I only hope we are not here then In places we are\\\\nonly about twenty yards away from Fritz and company Consequently all\\\\ntimes the air is pretty thick with bombs grenades and trench mortars\\\\nThese last are pretty hellish sort of toys They have an explosion like\\\\nabout ten earthquakes rolled into one But even these are not the worst\\\\nwe have to put up with The trenches being so close together there is of\\\\ncourse any amount of mining going on So one never knows when the\\\\nparticular lump of earth one is standing on is going to take a trip through\\\\nthe solar regions When a mine does go up there is some excitement\\\\nknocking about I can tell you Suppose for instance we were going to\\\\nexplode one all the artillery in the neighbourhood is ranged on the spot\\\\nand directly the mine is exploded there is hell let loose on the crater Of\\\\ncourse as soon as he gets the range the enemy replies so that the air is\\\\nfairly full of everything that kills quickly One can on these occasions\\\\nalways rely on a good many casualties Since we have been in this spasm\\\\nthere have been five exploded in this neighbourhood while others are\\\\nexpected to go up at any time So much for conditions here\\\\nHow is everything in town Pretty quiet I suppose I see youve had the\\\\nzepps Zeppelins over again Is it a fact that one dropped in the\\\\nThames Lines censored That is about all the news so will close\\\\nkindest regards to everybody Yours very sincerely\\\\nGilbert Williams Dear Mr Smith\\\\nI hope you will accept my apology for not writing before It has not been\\\\nwant of will it has been lack of opportunity I wonder how you all are I\\\\nam fairly well now but was very queer for several weeks recently I also\\\\noften wonder how you are all getting on and should like to hear\\\\nA matter of about five minutes ago Fritz was bombing us and I have just\\\\ngot up off the ground where I was laying for about twenty minutes One\\\\nfellow has been hit but not severely by shrapnel This is his second visit\\\\nthis evening\\\\nIt will soon be twelve months since I left you It seems a very long time\\\\nago I am afraid I have very little I may tell you so will conclude by\\\\nasking you to accept my best wishes for the New year and desiring that\\\\nyou will remember me kindly to any enquiring friends Believe me dear\\\\nMr Smith sincerely yours\\\\nW Wiggs Sunday\\\\nDear Charlie\\\\nHow are things going with you now I expect like the rest of us will be\\\\nglad when the better weather sets in for there is no doubt about it it has\\\\nbeen rough lately\\\\nSince I last wrote to you we have shifted to another part of the line and it\\\\nis a warm shop for both sides must have all guns they can find and it is\\\\nnothing but one long duel all day and every day but thank goodness it\\\\ngives over a bit a night so that one can get on with their work You see of\\\\na night the flashes of the guns can be seen so plainly that is why they do\\\\nnot fire a lot then\\\\nJust on our right our people retook some trenches we had lost oh what a\\\\nrough time the poor devils had snow and mud as much as you like and\\\\nthey had to lay in it for two days and grub could not be got to them I\\\\nexpect there have been a few more from Paddington called up by now it\\\\nseems if the authorities mean to have all the men they want and if they\\\\ncant get them one way they will another and it certainly looks as if they\\\\nwill be wanted for out here One cannot see any signs of an early\\\\nsettlement I see by the papers that the air raids have been busy in\\\\nEngland again I suppose you have not seen anything of them yet has\\\\nRory Moore had any more frights We have the taubes German aircraft\\\\nover our hospital nearly every day or night and I can tell you we got some\\\\nstarts at times The nearest we have to them since I have been here is\\\\njust one yard from the main door at 1230 it blew in two pairs of double\\\\ndoors and shattered on end of the building to bits but not a great deal of\\\\ndamage to life which after all is the main thing The arrangements we in\\\\nwork is five or six days up the line and four or five down if you are lucky\\\\nOf course at times these arrangements go to pot when there is an attack\\\\nand we get a warm time and I should like to enlarge on these things but\\\\nof course you understand I cannot\\\\nGive my kind regards to all and trusting you are well\\\\nYours Will Dear Mr WH Davies\\\\n\\\\nJust a line to let you know I have not forgotten you I received a letter on\\\\nTuesday 3rd of January 1917 which you sent to me on August 24th 1916\\\\nBy the marking on the envelope it has been round to various regiments\\\\nand officers but it has arrived quite safe at last I received the letter you\\\\nwrote in October quite safe I am sorry I have not written before but we\\\\nwere rather busy when I received your last letter and we could not send\\\\nmore than a field card for about a month Well I am pleased to tell you\\\\nthat I am still going on first rate I expect you will be surprised to hear\\\\nthat I have left the Northamptonshire Regiment and am now attached to\\\\nthe Army Printing and Stationary Services We are opening a new branch\\\\nin the photography line and I am here as a photographer\\\\nI am unable to tell you more than this up to the present I expect Harry\\\\nwill be pleased to hear this as he used to give me quite a lot of tuition in\\\\nthis respect\\\\nThere are only two of us here up to the present and as the dark rooms\\\\nare not finished yet we are having an easy time The Officer is away in\\\\nEngland just now getting some more photographic apparatus so we are\\\\non our own and I am in charge\\\\nWe are billeted with a company of Australian electricians mechanics\\\\nmining and boring engineers and are having a fine time There are a good\\\\nlot of fellows and make us very welcome We had a grand Xmas with\\\\nthem and they know how to enjoy themselves You can understand what\\\\na change this is after being in the line Just before I came on this job we\\\\nhad over a month in and out of the line waiting to go over the top when\\\\nthe weather was favourable\\\\nWe went in for four days then out for a rest for about three days then\\\\nback again The water was over our knees in the trenches and it was\\\\nimpossible to use the communication trenches at all We were holding the\\\\nfront line with two platoons I should say our boys section of the line\\\\nOur platoon was twenty two strong including the Officer and during the\\\\nbombardment we had eight put out in ten minutes There were no\\\\ndugouts of any description there so you can imagine what it was like to\\\\nstand there for four nights We hoped the weather would be alright so\\\\nthat we could go over and get it done with but it was not to be We were\\\\nout digging one night when they let us have it for five hours with gas\\\\nshells we had two chaps hit with them and put right out\\\\nThe sights and smells were awful as a good many of the chaps lay just as\\\\nthey fell during the advance It was impossible to bury them Also there\\\\nwere about a dozen dead horses round about in the mud that were killed\\\\nby shell fire while bringing up ammunition for the guns Our guns never\\\\ncease down there as soon as one section stop another lot open out so\\\\nyou can tell there is Somme noise\\\\nThe last time we came out was for forty eight hours rest then in again\\\\nand over but the troops were in such a bad condition that the doctor sent\\\\nin a report saying we were not fit for the line so two other regiments in\\\\nour division went over in our place\\\\nWe were held in reserve and I am glad to say not required after all Well I\\\\nthink this is about all for now I have been with the AP  SS since\\\\nDecember 1st and I can tell you I hope I shall stop here I have no desire\\\\nto go back to the line Kindly remember me to all old friends With kind\\\\nregards to yourself and all on Section 4\\\\nYours sincerely HA Skilling\\\\nNo 2 Section Advanced Section\\\\nArmy Printing  Stationary Service Dear Mr Taylor\\\\nNo doubt you think that I have forgotten all about you and my friends of\\\\nthe Audit but never let it be said this is an army term if you please\\\\nTruth to tell I have been going to write time after time but have had to\\\\nput it off for various reasons I am taking this opportunity of writing to\\\\nyou while I am in charge of tonights guard I get this job about once a\\\\nweek now its not so bad I have three men and a man in waiting we\\\\nmount at 5pm and dismiss at 7am We make ourselves as comfortable as\\\\nwe can in the guard tent which just covers over the top of the sand\\\\nbags and these have got grass growing out of them now The sand bags \\\\nare about 4ft high and make a good protection April 1st I got my two\\\\nstripes up after being a 1st Air Mechanic for 12 months the NonCommissioned Officers have a very decent mess here and everything is\\\\nok I am corporal in charge of wireless photographic electrical and all\\\\ninstruments used on aeroplanes I have had a very good education on all\\\\nthose subjects but the one I like best is the wireless its far more\\\\ninteresting than photography which is a very big thing indeed out here\\\\nand a lot depends upon a good photograph of the Hun lines\\\\nYesterday I saw a nice little game between one of ours and one of theirs\\\\nafter our antiaircraft fire had taken it up a bit higher our machine went\\\\nfor it and got well over the top of it then two more of ours came along\\\\nand forced it down she tried all manner of tricks but down she came\\\\nalright and landed a clean machine not broken in any part and the two\\\\nHuns inside it quite well\\\\nWe gave a revue theatrical show to our chaps here on the 13th it went\\\\noff alright we started at 9pm and gave a two hours show am enclosing\\\\nprogramme and will forward a photo of myself as the oldest

sincerely\\\\nFR Morris Dear Charles\\\\nJust a line to let you know I am getting on fine I have been in France\\\\nsince Good Friday morning Well it is not so bad but of course not so\\\\ncomfortable as the office work\\\\nWe had the Lord Mayor of London over to see us the other Sunday when\\\\nwe were resting he made a little speech\\\\nHow are all at the office You might remember me to Mr Woodhams Mr\\\\nJones and Mr Cowan and the boys also the girls I suppose Mr Redford\\\\nhas retired by now\\\\nWe have been in the trenches since the 13th and I expect we shall go out\\\\nshortly Our little dugout has just been flooded out a very heavy\\\\nthunderstorm but we have run it out It is rotten to see how the towns\\\\nhave been shelled to pieces I dont suppose they will ever be rebuilt\\\\nMy brother was home on leave some time ago that is the second time so\\\\nhe has not got off badly He has been promoted to Sergeant now He\\\\nseems to be getting on fine\\\\nHave you seen Ernie Smith How is he getting on is he still in the APC\\\\nArmy Pay Corps nonfighting troops As I hear a lot have been\\\\ntransferred into line regiments\\\\nWell heres to the time when the war is all over and we are back in the\\\\nsame old place The trenches where we were are only 25 to 30 yards from\\\\nthe Huns so had to keep a bit low\\\\nMy address is 3343 Lance Corporal J Davies No 1 Platoon D Company\\\\n6th City of London Rifles BEF France You might drop me a line to let\\\\nme know how you are getting on and any news\\\\nKind regards The worst has happened The War Office has sent us down to this place which is miles from nowhere The camp however is made up of hundreds of huts is according to the old uns at the game the finest they have ever been in certainly everything is alright but the place is so muddy and my time is split up One half getting frightfully dirty and the other getting myself clean again However its all in the game and cant be helped There are twenty to a hut The beds are three long boards on two trestles about eight or nine inches off the floor a straw mattress and a straw pillow and four blankets Not a bit what I have been used to However I am now quite comfortable in it and sleep like a top Marvellous how you think we settle down to it Dont you think We rise at 630am Breakfast porridge and bacon at 730 Parade at 820 Drill till 1030 Then half an hours rest Then more drill up to 1230 Dinner at 1 oclock meat and two vegetables and sweets Parade again at 220 Then more drill which brings us up to 4pm We are then dismissed for the day Tea at 5pm bread butter and jam After which we can do what we like until 915 By this time we have to be in our huts for the final days roll call and at 10pm All lights have to be out Thats what my day consists of at present It may not seem much and really it isnt but I am half the day cleaning up The grub is alright but there is not quite enough of it at present I think however this will be right as soon as they have made all necessary arrangements For the time being the NonCommissioned Officers seem to be a little overworked This is the same every day varied on two mornings a week with a long route march in the morning Of course we only have half a day on Saturday and only a Church parade on Sunday So altogether things are not so bad The only thing is I cant get away for weekends as it would take up most of the time to travel to London and back I shall try however and run up to town in a few weeks time if possible I had meant to write to you when I could tell that I was definitely settled but as it now seems that some time must lapse before that happy consummation I decided that I would wait no longer Felixstowe is the largest and most important of all the home stations It is an experimental and educational station ie all sorts of machines and inventions are given a chance here and a large number of young officers are taught to fly sea planes There are between seven hundred and eight hundred men on the station the greatest proportion being mechanics So you will readily appreciate that the work of the Stores Officer is no sinecure Another man was sent down with me for training he served in Gallipoli with a machine gun section and afterwards worried the Senussi a reference to Western Desert campaign in North Africa in an armoured car and as he collected eight machine gun bullets in his anatomy he was sent home and down here for stores work He is an exceedingly good chap and my great chum The stores here were being temporarily carried on by the carpenter a commissioned Warrant Officer and it was quite thought that I or my friend would be appointed as a matter of fact I was recommended for the post and was halfway through the muster stock taking and only awaited confirmation from the Admiralty But today orders came to stand at ease and it appears that some other man is being sent here It is really no disappointment as I didnt care in the least where I am sent and I have now learnt enough to take over any old stores I will let you know when anything is decided Of the work of the station I cannot of course tell you much it is all intensely interesting and one really feels quite near the thing We have had four raids since I was here and they are truly fascinating We have a very lively six inch gun quite near our billet and when shes busy we begin to enjoy ourselves The boom of the falling bombs the crack of our gun the shriek of its shell and the fantasia of a dozen search lights provide a most excellent entertainment of course Harwich Harbour and our adjoining Air Station are objectives of the first order I shall be very glad to hear from you and to know any changes or events in the Audit office it all seems very far away and I cant see myself back there again I had fortyeight hours leave for my daughters wedding on the 23rd of August she and her husband leave for India on the 23rd instant a great wrench for me I suppose you will have retired before I get back but I hope we may not altogether lose sight of each other Regarding this over it seems all very tame but directly I want to say anything interesting I am brought up sharp Kindest regards to you and all my friends in the Agreements How are things going with you now I expect like the rest of us will be glad when the better weather sets in for there is no doubt about it it has been rough lately Since I last wrote to you we have shifted to another part of the line and it is a warm shop for both sides must have all guns they can find and it is nothing but one long duel all day and every day but thank goodness it gives over a bit a night so that one can get on with their work You see of a night the flashes of the guns can be seen so plainly that is

one way they will another and it certainly looks as if they will be wanted for out here One cannot see any signs of an early settlement I see by the papers that the air raids have been busy in England

starts at times The nearest we have to them since I have been here is just one yard from the main door at 1230 it blew in two pairs of double doors and shattered on end of the building to bits but not a great deal of damage to life which after all is the main thing The arrangements we in work is five or six days up the line and four or five down if you are lucky Of course at times these arrangements go to pot when there is an attack and we get a warm time and I should like to enlarge on these things but of course you understand I cannot No doubt perhaps you had thought I had forgotten old friends at Paddington but such is not the case We so not have much spare time for letter writing now To tell you of all our adventures since we left England would take too long here to relate but I will save for when I come home Perhaps you have heard we were only at Farnborough four days before we were sent over there By God old chap we did have a time of it the first fortnight Living on bully beef and biscuits travelling day and night and sleeping anywhere and doing long tramps with full kit on nearly done us in as we had no training We managed to stick it through but I thought poor Percy Smith would have to give in as he was very queer with toothache The first six weeks we moved about from place to place doing all sorts of fatigue work bar our own Lambert Smith Collins and myself are now settled down in H the place where Mr Lakers son was so long at Collins and Lambert have been fortunate enough to get temporary clerical work during the last months I was promised one when on the 17th of last month I was wounded by a bomb from a taube which landed clean through our billet at 12 oclock at night when we were all sound asleep I caught it in the thigh but luckily it was only a flesh wound but I had some awful bruises from the debris which fell on it I have been in hospital ever since at the base but I am pleased to say I am now nearly well again and in a convalescent camp three miles from there overlooking the sea We are not allowed to put our address at the heading of a letter so I will put it here 2AM WP Mansbridge No16929 Royal Flying Corps No G 21 Hut no 6 Convalescent Depot APO S17 British Expeditionary Force After I am discharged from here I shall be sent up to the base and then up the line with the best of luck as the Tommies say out here I am hoping to get back to H as I was so happy and with such decent fellows there but I dont think it probable Lambert Smith and myself often used to talk of old times and wondered how things were at Paddington I daresay Gerald there are not many young fellows left in the Audit are there has Mr Horsley gone Do drop me a line when you have time as I assure you old boy it is a real treat to hear Paddington news I have never felt in better health army life certainly agrees with me also with Lambert Billy Button is at headquarters got a cushy job I believe I saw him once there but I have no idea where the other GW fellows are I am afraid I am not very fluent with my French yet I could have done with your services on several occasions How are Mr Slater and other members of the Stats or is that department disbanded Please remember kindly to them Just a few lines to let you know I arrived safely after visiting several places which I am not allowed to mention This place is quite oriental as the fronts of the houses are for the most part looked after and kept in repair while the backs are allowed to go and it gives one a shock to see a fine building in the front and then to go to the back and see it all neglected and ready to fall down It is very hot here during the day and the swarms of flies and mosquitoes keep one very busy and I dread to think what it will be like in the summer It seems strange to see oxen drawing carts and donkeys with packs on but it is a very common sight here I sometimes have to go to the big steamers in a small pinnace ships boat and when it is rough it requires some nerve to walk along the sides of barges that are pitching and tossing and then climb up the ships side by a rope ladder but it comes easier in time It is very mountainous here and we get a very fine view of Mount Olympus and the snowcapped peaks I had to go by motor up country the other day and I had to grip the side of the car as the roads are awful and sometimes there is only just room for the car to travel and a sheer drop on the other side The labourers at the docks are Greeks and when they are taken on in the mornings it is a regular Babel till the Military Policeman uses his persuader\\xa0truncheon right and left and that calms them somewhat I have not met Mr Coxs son yet but should I do so I will make myself known to him I have had to revert to sapper again as there are not sufficient men of our staff for us to remain NCOs but if it is brought up to strength I am promised them again The first person I saw here was Gray of the Stats Statistical Department and we are working together Trusting that you are quite well and with kindest regards to Messrs Cox Slater Rogers and Hunt Just a few lines to let you know things are going Am having a fairly good time nothing at all to grumble about I dont think I shall be going to France for a few months yet I met one of the chaps from the tickets department last week he is in the RFC down here Some of us were feet under canvas for a fortnight but owing to the wind and rain we were moved back to the huts When we were under canvas we used not get up till 8 oclock we were supposed to go on parade at 615am but we dodged that I enclose photo not dressed for the occasion outside our hut L20 or Hell 20 as it has been called I am looking forward to seeing some of the office chaps when I am able to get leave I hope your brother is getting on alright in France Hoping you are in the pink like myself I guess you wonder what has become of me after this long silence but you will see I am a good distance away from the homeland now I arrived here early in April and since the start have been getting on quite well You may be interested to know that Gray from your department is also here It is rather strange that I should rub against him The weather is brilliant cloudless skies day after day but it is very hot There are plenty of mosquitoes about They are very tantalising A net is practically a necessity for sleeping purposes I am billeted in a warehouse it is a very old place and has stood hundreds of years I should think according to its general appearance I have not picked up the lingo yet but French is chiefly spoken and I much regret not having studied it more when I had the opportunity at home This town is a queer sort of place as compared with some of the French towns we know and am sure I shall not wish to see it again when once I leave The cafés are not so gay as the French but I manage to have fun occasionally We have got a piano and gramophone to amuse ourselves with I hope we shall be able to have another trip to Paris when the war has cleared up but of course when is a question nobody can answer yet awhile Shall be very pleased to hear some news of you and conclude now with all the best I am sorry I have been so long replying to your letter but I have had my hands rather full just lately so hope you will not mind As I cannot get at my kit bag at present I shall only be able to write you a short letter because I have nearly run out of paper envelopes so I shall have to make up for it next time I expect you wonder what has become of me as you have not heard from me for such a long time The reason is that since the 20th\\xa0September I have been suffering with enteric typhoid The exact diagnosis of my case being para typhoid B I have not been up three weeks until next Friday but since I first got out of bed I have made splendid progress I was in an isolation hospital in France for six weeks and previous to that in a General Hospital for eight days I arrived here late last Wednesday night after a very decent journey This is a beautiful palace surrounded by a park in which we can walk about and we are allowed to go to the post office which is quite near I am quite happy and comfortable here it is a splendid hospital We have a concert or cinema nearly every night in the big hall Food is good and plentiful How long it will be before I am considered fit again I have no notion as a rule it takes months for a person to get right again It is a very funny and beastly complaint During to the whole time I have been in hospital I have received every attention and kindness During the months of July and August when I was in the Somme district I had a very rough time was nearly worked to death and had little sleep At one period we had to commence work at 2am but we were supposed to rest in the day but we could not get any However it was all in a good cause and we got through it Ambulance trains were loaded up at the station where I was and we saw some awful sights English and German wounded Perhaps I picked my fever up at this place but one never knows While I was in the isolation hospital in France I was kept for three weeks and two days on liquids but I am pleased to say that the doctor has now put me on ordinary diet With the kindest regards and best wishes to all I remain yours obediently Thank you and the other gents very much for the cigarettes which I received yesterday on coming out from the line We have been having exciting times lately Our division took a big part in this new advance on the Ancre In fact it was our Brigade that captured Beaumont Hamel and after two days hand fighting the ridge beyond the village We went over before day break on the 13th\\xa0November and from there till the evening of 14th\\xa0we were properly in the midst of it The greatest handicaps we had were fog and mud It is really wonderful how the boys kept their direction in the mist which was very thick while the mud began to swallow one up unless one was wary The Germans thought the village was impregnable and up to now it has resisted all efforts to capture it Their artillery and snipers gave us some trouble but once we were at close quarters with them they absolutely refused to fight and were only too eager to be captured For the most part they were a very measly looking lot and very young and some of them burst into tears when I pointed my bayonet at them By Jove Bertie those Germans look after their creature comforts Fine deep dugouts and any amount of shirts and socks and cases of soda water etc I got a souvenir or two a German helmet and one or two more things The worst part of the whole business was cleaning up the battlefield afterwards Thats about all the news Regards to the Audit agreements section and the rest of the boys Lines censored Just a line to let you know I have not forgotten you I received a letter on Tuesday 3rd\\xa0of January 1917 which you sent to me on August 24th\\xa01916 By the marking on the envelope it has been round to various regiments and officers but it has arrived quite safe at last I received the letter you wrote in October quite safe I am sorry I have not written before but we were rather busy when I received your last letter and we could not send more than a field card for about a month Well I am pleased to tell you that I am still going on first rate I expect you will be surprised to hear that I have left the Northamptonshire Regiment and am now attached to the Army Printing and Stationary Services We are opening a new branch in the photography line and I am here as a photographer I am unable to tell you more than this up to the present I expect Harry will be pleased to hear this as he used to give me quite a lot of tuition in this respect  There are only two of us here up to the present and as the dark rooms are not finished yet we are having an easy time The Officer is away in England just now getting some more photographic apparatus so we are on our own and I am in charge We are billeted with a company of Australian electricians mechanics mining and boring engineers and are having a fine time There are a good lot of fellows and make us very welcome We had a grand Xmas with them and they know how to enjoy themselves You can understand what a change this is after being in the line Just before I came on this job we had over a month in and out of the line waiting to go over the top when the weather was favourable We went in for four days then out for a rest for about three days then back again The water was over our knees in the trenches and it was impossible to use the communication trenches at all We were holding the front line with two platoons I should say our boys section of the line Our platoon was twenty two strong including the Officer and during the bombardment we had eight put out in ten minutes There were no dugouts of any description there so you can imagine what it was like to stand there for four nights We hoped the weather would be alright so that we could go over and get it done with but it was not to be We were out digging one night when they let us have it for five hours with gas shells we had two chaps hit with them and put right out\\nThe sights and smells were awful as a good many of the chaps lay just as they fell during the advance It was impossible to bury them Also there were about a dozen dead horses round about in the mud that were killed by shell fire while bringing up ammunition for the guns Our guns never cease down there as soon as one section stop another lot open out so you can tell there is Somme noise The last time we came out was for forty eight hours rest then in again and over but the troops were in such a bad condition that the doctor sent in a report saying we were not fit for the line so two other regiments in our division went over in our place We were held in reserve and I am glad to say not required after all Well I think this is about all for now I have been with the AP  SS since December 1st and I can tell you I hope I shall stop here I have no desire to go back to the line Kindly remember me to all old friends With kind regards to yourself and all on Section 4\\n\\n My Dearest Will I feel I must write you again dear altho there is not much news to tell you I wonder how you are getting on I shall be so relieved to get a letter from you I cant help feeling a bit anxious dear I know how you must have felt darling when you did not get my letters for so long Of course I know dear you will write as soon as ever you can but the time seems so dull and weary without any news of you if only this war was over dear and we were together again It will be one day I suppose Dont think dear I am worrying unnecessarily about you because I know God can take care of you wherever you are and if its his will darling he will so are you to come back to me thats how I feel about it dear if we only put our trust in Him I am sure he will I wonder how your Cousins are getting on dear We are feeling very anxious about George as no news has come from him yet We cant understand why his wife doesnt write How are your hands now dear Mine are very sore so chapped and my left hand has got several chilblains on it and they do irritate I could scratch it to bits Have you been receiving the books I have sent you dear I am very pleased to say dear I am keeping very well indeed and I trust you are the same There has been a bit of a fuss over Arthur this week He has been trying to get in the Army unbeknown to his parents but Mrs T thought his parents ought to be informed about it so she wrote and told them about him and he had to go home in hot haste last night I guess he got in a fine row but he wont say today He is as miserable as anything Really Will I never saw such a boy as he is I am afraid he is going to the bad I dont know if Mrs T will keep him on or not He says he has to join up in a fortnight but as he is under age I suppose his parents could stop him I dont know whether they will or not For my part I hope he does go he will be a jolly good riddance for there is nothing but rows and deceitfulness going on where he is Well darling I dont know much more to say now so will close with fondest love and kisses from your loving little girl Emily PS Cheer up darling and dont worry about me I am quite alright only anxious to get your letters There is good news in the papers Love from Mum and Dad Dear Gertie I have written two or three times recently so you may get them together We have been very busy for the last few weeks and have got through a great amount of work We are much better off again as regards potatoes and other food stuffs for we have had a great quantity of stores I fancy we shall be here for a time yet anyway it looks like it with such a quantity of stores aboard You will see I am telling you the same things over and over again At least I know I have told you them once or twice but everything about is all of a sameness kind of thing Ships here there and everywhere now But soon we shall have a move that is when we can get through the White Sea We shall have to look after all the shipping The snow is fast disappearing now I came across an article in a paper the other day about this district and it said that 14 or 15 years ago bears used to roam around hear sic but there seems to be nothing around now excepting the wild fowl which are very numorous I believe salmon are numerous at certain times of the year The 2nd and 3rd of May we had a terrific snow blizzard We should have left the ship to go away and do some work on another ship but we could not get away from our ship it was so rough We have no night now the sun goes down but it never goes dark it is eternally daylight Of course I told you we have had an entire change round and I have a new job now part of the ship I have not half the time I used to have but I enjoy the robust work much better and I get to see much more with working away We get up at 630 and work until 100 so we put a few hours in dont we That is when we are working away Did you get the 100 I remitted Let me know I have remitted another 300 this month Let me know if you receive this also I shall probably send a little more next month or later Dont hold the paper money Bank it or keep it by you in gold until I come home Tell Dad I shall to him as soon as I can get enough to tell him about Give my best love to everyone at home I often think about you all I am yours ever Ted The soldiers at the front need more rest While in the trenches the water is over our knees most of the time The war is going to last some time yet and might be another twelve months before it is over The war has only just begun and its going to be a war of exhaustion After the regular armies have done their work it means that all the young lads at home being trained and disciplined and will take our place in the field The sooner people understand this the better it will be for the nation We have just come out of the trenches after being in for six days and up to our waists in water While we were in the trenches one of the Germans came over to our trench for a cigarette and then back again and he was not fired at We and the Germans started walking about in the open between the two trenches repairing them and there was no firing at all I think they are all getting fed up with it We started away just after dawn from our camp and I think it was about an hour later that we encountered the enemy They were on the opposite side of the valley and as we came over the brow of the hill they opened on us with rifle fire and shrapnel from about 900 yards We lost three officers and about 100 men killed and wounded in that half hour I do not want any more days like that one this section censored Anyway we drove the Germans back and held them there for eight days I cannot tell you all I should like to as it would never reach you I have not written to you for a long time but I have thought of you all the more as a silent creditor But when one owes letters one suffers from them so to speak at the same time It is indeed not so simple a matter to write from the war really from the war and what you read as Field Post letters in the papers usually have their origin in the lack of understanding that does not allow a man to get hold of the war to breathe it in although he is living in the midst of it The further I penetrate its true inwardness the more I see the hopelessness of making it comprehensive for those who only understand life in the terms of peacetime and apply these same ideas to war in spite of themselves They only think that they understand it It is as if fishes living in water would have a clear conception of what living in the air is like When one is hauled out on to dry land and dies in the air then he will know something about it So it is with the war Feeling deeply about it one becomes less able to talk about it every day Not because one understands it less each day but because one grasps it better But it is a silent teacher and he who learns becomes silent too I have an old platoon roll before me three pages of names numbers trades nextofkin religions rifle numbers and so forth Faces come back out of the past to answer to these barren details the face of this man dead of that vanished for ever Here and there rise memories of their habits their nicknames the look of one as he spoke to you the attitude of another shivering in the night air as he leaned over the parapet watching with tired bloodshot eyes Some of the faces have disappeared did I know you I censored your letters casually hurriedly avoiding your personal messages your poignant hopes We are now 150yd from Fritz and the moon is bright so we bend and walk quietly onto the road running diagonally across the front into the Bosche line There is a stream the far side of this  boards have been put across it at intervals but must have fallen in  about 20yd down we can cross We stop and listen  swish  and down we plop for a flare lights everything up it goes out with a hiss and over the board we trundle on hands and knees Still Apparently no one has seen so we proceed to crawl through a line of French wire Now for 100yd dead flat weedland with here and there a shell hole or old webbing equipment lying in little heaps These we avoid This means a slow slow crawl head down propelling ourselves by toes and forearm body and legs flat on the ground like it snake A working party of Huns are in their lair We can just see dark shadows and hear the Sergeant who is sitting down Hes got a bad cold We must wait a bit the moons getting low but its too bright now 5 am They will stop soon and if we go on we may meet a covering party lying low 510 515 525 530 And the moons gone The Bosch is moving and we crawl quickly on to the wire  past two huge shell holes to the first row A potent row of standards are the first with a nut at the top and strand upon strand of barbed wire The nut holds the two iron pieces at the top and the ends are driven into the ground 3ft apart Evidently this line is made behind the parapet and brought out the legs of the standard falling together All the joins where the strands cross are neatly done with a separate piece of plain wire Out comes the wire cutter I hold the strands to prevent them jumping apart when cut and Stafford cuts Twentyfive strands are cut and the standard pulled out Two or three tins are cut off as we go These tins are hung on to give warning and one must beware of them Next a space 4ft then low wire entanglements as we cut on through to a line of iron spikes and thick heavy barbed wire The standard has three furls to hold the wire up and strive as we can it wont come out By love its a corkscrew twist it round and then wonder of wonders up it goes and out it comes It is getting light a long streak has already appeared and so we just make a line of knife rests wire on wooden XX against the German parapet and proceed to return I take the corkscrew and Stafford the iron double standard My corkscrew keeps on catching and Stafford has to extract me twice from the wire his standard is smooth and only 3ft so he travels lighter He leads back down a bit of ditch Suddenly a sentry fires 2 shots which spit on the ground a few yards in front We lie absolutely flat scarcely daring to breathe  has he seen Then we go on with our trophies the ditch gets a little deeper giving cover My heart is beating nineteen to the dozen  will it mean a machine gun Stafford is gaining and leads by 10yd My God I think it is a listening post ahead and this the ditch to it I must stop him I whisper Stafford Stafford and feel I am shouting He stops thinking I have got it Do you think its a listening post There By the mound  listen I laugh Forgot that damned wire Our own wire outside our listening post The LP occupants have gone in Soon we are behind the friendly parapet and it is day We are ourselves again but theres a subtle cord between us stronger than barbed wire that will take a lot of cutting Twenty to seven 2 hrs 10 minutes of life  war at its best But shelling no thats death at its worst And I cant go again its a vice Immediately after I swear Ill never do it again the next night I find myself aching after No Mans Land \\n you must excuse me for being so long in writing as I feel like crawling into a hole and never coming out again Im the miserablest and sorriest man in all the world since poor old George was killed we were like brothers we were never apart out of the lines they used to call us husband and wife in Batt Battalion so you can tell how much I miss him I did not know he was killed until we came out of the lines either as he was transferred into the Machine gun section a few weeks ago and I was in the bommers sic its the first time we had been parted in the lines oh dear Jeanie the way I feel this last few weeks I wish I were gone with him Well dear little girl I can just imagine how you\\nall fell feel at home being so far away but we will all try and cheer up and pray to\\nGod that we may meet in the next world everyone in the Batt thought such a lot of\\nhim he was so good and kind anyone that knew him couldnt help but like him and\\nhe had grown such a fine boy since he left Australia he must have stood six foot and\\nwas nearly 13 stone so you can guess how he filled out and grew I cant realise sic\\nits true yet oh how I wish it wasnt every line makes my heartache no dought\\ndoubt poor boy he is better off but it is us that are left behind that will suffer all his\\ndear ones that loved him so well but we will all bear up a little for poor old Georges\\nsake he wouldnt like to see all so downhearted I am sure of that I am verry verry sic sorry to have to bring back old memories to all Georges dear\\nones at home but I know you would like to hear as much as you can about him he\\nwas never so happy as when he was in the lines plugging at old Fritz Ill bet he\\nmade the dirty wretches suffer this time with his machine gun before he died by what\\nI can hear from one of the chaps that was near him at the time he was killed\\ninstantous instantaneous It was on the 5th of April at a place called Dernacourt\\nword censored poor old boy was shot through the head as soon as we go up there\\nagain I will do his grave up with some flowers we are trasferred transferred into\\ndifferent Batt now there is words censored Well dear Jean I will close with deepest\\nsympathy to all at home and with tons of love to all your sincere friend Aussy  Many thanks for your bright  chirpy letter of 16 October I have attended Church Parade this afternoon  after the dullest of dull services conducted by a Padre who it seems to me was quite without personality your letter was particularly welcomed Dont look to me to give your Parisian accent Firstly I think it most improbable that we will have any opportunity of visiting Paris which  compliment I will assume is the only fine place in this country Secondly I havent even as much bothered to concern myself with the easiest phrases I havent much time for one thing  certainly\\nhave no inclination I confess to having no love for the country or the people  I will\\nshould the War finish tomorrow I would be only too glad to say goodbye to the place for\\never\\nWe are getting a taste of Winter alright The sun very rarely shines  we have a kind of\\ndaylight from about 8am to 4pm but it is rather dull  often foggy\\nI am particularly well  in spite of commencing this letter in the strain I have written in\\nexcellent spirits After coming out of the Trenches this last time I wasnt too good for\\nseveral days We had a hard time of It  to add to our trials had to tramp for about eight hours before reaching the Camp\\nplaced for us I had had practically no sleep for four days had lived in mud 18 thick thro\\nrain  snow  felt absolutely done up I struggled into a hut wrapped myself in a couple\\nof blankets  hardly stirred for over 24 hours I then made an effort to tidy myself My\\nappearance when I had a look at myself in a mirror was mirth provoking beyond doubt A description is beyond me but try  picture in mud  rain soaked clothes hair unbrushed\\nfor a week face unshaven  unwashed for a similar time  still carrying much Trench\\nmud  other varieties of that despised article We are now quietly billeted in a very small village As a matter of fact the village reminds\\nme very much of the Homestead  outbuildings in a large farm These are all clustered\\ntogether very old whitewashed  with thatched or tiled roofs The villagers are all poor\\nThe surrounding country is all agricultural  no matter which direction you take you will\\nnot find even the smallest area not under cultivation of some sort Of course there are no\\nfences quite a feature in this country The county is interesting in a sense low hills rising\\n falling anywhere They build small Haystacks here  it would take three or four of them\\nto make one of the usual stacks which we are accustomed to at home\\nI shall be mighty glad to get home  I will have much pleasure in singing Good\\nCompany to your accompaniment We make a big noise at times As a matter of fact it it\\nhadnt been for a few choruses the train journey we had a few days would have been\\nunbearable\\nI hope you meet with success as Schoolmarm I love that term Do you remember a\\nnovel called the Virginian by Owen Wisten very popular a few years ago The heroine\\nwas called by that title  a jolly fine story it was too\\nExpect to be in the line overtimes We will be out I think for about another fortnight Trust\\nwe will have an easier time than last which was very serious\\nHope to hear from you often Perhaps next time may be more cheerful Feel that Ive\\nbeen rather blue dull this time but blame the weather Many thanks for your letter which I have just received During the last few days I have been favoured too with letters from your sisters Carrie and Nellie to whom I have also written by this mail Well I liked you playing tit for tat as regards your name and address but the pencil Ive\\na good mind to purchase a dozen fountain pens and never write in pencil again Ill\\nexcuse your pencil writing this time but please try to imagine daylight from about 8 am\\nto 330 pm and always dull when you are about to write again We have been through a pretty exciting time during the last month Was under another\\nattack made under very heavy machine gun and rifle fire and had a dinkum fight with\\nbombs I got through without harm which is rather marvelous This was our first time in\\nthe trenches Our second was a little quieter although we had a pretty big job on one\\nnight which was more than ordinarily dangerous The next morning we had our first experience of snow how would you like a little of it\\nnow after which it rained continuously all day and night We were relieved that night\\nand then moved back to a camp taking eight hours to do the journey You might be able\\nto imagine the state of the country after the rain It is nothing but shell holes which have\\nbeen partially filled with water and the ground was slippery We were in a fine state when\\nwe reached our destination We are quite happy now however I have been away from the line for a fortnight and\\nfeeling much refreshed It was a great comfort to get a comfortable bed to be able to eat\\nin a civilized manner at a table to be able to wash your face daily and even to have\\nwarm water for a shave We are billeted in a small village a very old place It is quite\\nclean however and it is a treat to be able to move about on roads which were not a foot\\ndeep in mud Between our two tours on the front line we were camped in huts placed 150 yards off the\\nroad and the whole surrounding area was mud a foot thick It was glorious The roads\\nwerent much better the traffic on them being enormous Continuously a stream going\\neach way the poor old infantry trying to wend their way through all this in constant\\ndanger of being wholly crushed by a motor lorry or else being trodden on by a heavy\\ndraught horse and collecting quantities of mud on uniforms and faces It is extremely cold but I think I can stand this alright It is so cold that a small lake on the\\nroadside has remained frozen except where broken by idle stone throwers for several\\ndays I like this place and would be perfectly satisfied to be here for the duration It is\\nvery quiet but I never want much else than a quiet life when out for a rest The socalled rest consists of parades a greater length than we are used to in Australia but they are\\nmost essential in building us up after trench life which makes one horribly tired I am having a great time tonight writing to catch the mail which is leaving here next\\nSaturday There will probably be very little opportunity again for a few weeks Many thanks for your congratulations It has been particularly gratifying to my vanity receiving numerous letters from my SA friends and it almost requires a superhuman effort to act and think normally However I am persuading myself gradually that I am only a very ordinary soldier who up to now has been exceptionally fortunate Before attempting a brief outline of my recent work I wish to thank you for the miniature\\nphoto which I like very much and am very glad to have I hope the time is not far distant\\nwhen Ill have the opportunity of calling at 183 Archer Street and letting you see that I am\\nstill in possession of it And you mustnt allow such a long interval to happen again I\\nenjoyed your last one immensely When I get home again Ill see that the detail about the\\nsize of the photo is put right I notice that you were staying with Chris Kneebones people when you wrote I wish he\\nwas with the battalion at present He was away sick in November and has not yet come\\nback I understand that he has been doing well but I am afraid that he will be sent to the\\n3rd battalion in the next Division being formed in England If he were here at the present\\ntime he would have a splendid opportunity for promotion At present we are right forwards and as our work is done entirely at night I usually put in\\nan hour in the afternoons writing letters to friends in SA  quite the most pleasing way of\\ndiverting ones thoughts and attention to the shelling that is always going on We were a\\nlong way back enjoying a fortnights rest before moving up this time One fine day we\\nmade a long march about 12 miles carrying full weight It was quite enjoyable\\nparticularly the latter part of the journey when we were in comparatively fresh country It\\nis a great relief from the dismal area where the opposing forces held lines and trenches\\nfor so many months During the last eight or nine weeks we have made great advances forwards and the\\nwhole aspect is changed It is a wonderful tonic to everybody this pushing of the enemy\\nback We were in tents for three or four days and these were more or less miserable\\nhaving to do pretty heavy work in continuous rain The night we moved up here it was\\nfine and ever since we have had fine days We have been here six days and the\\nweather has been glorious Fine clear cloudless days  just a slight keenness in the air \\nand the nights moderately warm You would scarcely realize the difference in the\\nconditions now and those of ten weeks ago Preparations are being made for another\\nbig push and practically all the work is done at night We have posts in the trenches\\nwhich can be made more comfortable than usual Others have little shelters built into the\\nsides of sunken walls I am at present in charge of the company I am attached to With a bit of luck I would have\\nnow been enjoying Blighty leave My OC was evacuated sick so I couldnt be spared\\nconceit However it isnt too bad up here I am having some enjoyment in the way of\\nletter writing You should just see my new quarters Where I am there is a sunken road\\nas a result of many hours of work and it has now built into quite a  home Of course if\\na shell hit the bank Id probably get smothered and there is always the chance of\\nshrapnel finding a passage in but such contingencies cannot always be provided for\\nAnd if there were absolutely no risk what a dull show it would be  I dont think Maybe well be relieved up here in about a week when I shall in all probability be given\\nmy leave I feel that I could enjoy myself in spite of the fact that it is such a long time\\nPlease write some more chirpy letters and write them more frequently than has been the\\ncase lately Many thanks for your letter of 17th June which I received a week or so ago And the parcel I received that yesterday  contents just splendid Ive nearly made myself ill with the chocolate but please dont consider that when packing the next one The sugar is a bright idea Fortunately we not so unhappily situated as most civilians who have great troubles in getting this useful commodity It is a great stunt at country hotels now the people taking into the Diggers Hall their own sugar finding the allowance as regulated by the food Controller being insufficient for their needs It is hardly playing the game I suppose but I must confess that I was a guilty partner in a similar situation whilst on my leave a few days ago I am just finishing up my tour of duty here and return to France I think early next week\\njust in time to get into a big dustup which has been getting ready for us for quite a long\\nwhile However it has got to be done I suppose We cant expect to be having\\nexperiences such as I have been enjoying recently all the time I have had my ten days leave and return on Saturday night Four days I spent in London\\nand most of the remaining time I was at Torquay in Devon In London I did the usual\\nround of restaurants theatre and crowded much into the short time Torquay was lovely\\nI never have had such a wondrous experience Devon is known as perhaps the most\\nbeautiful county in England and Torquay is possibly the prettiest part of that county I\\nmet some very charming and interesting people and for the moment I am madly in love\\nwith the country and the people To attempt any description of this beautiful place is quite\\nbeyond me and I will I am sure be thinking of it often so that by the time that I return I\\nmay be able to give you some fair idea Kindly apologise to Nellie and Mollie for their cards I will write at the first opportunity I received your letter of 25th November a few days ago Many thanks for your introduction to Miss Hall I had a note from her yesterday and if I am near Salisbury again I shall certainly call I wish I had known whilst I was with the Training Battalion as I could have got into Salisbury almost any time and would have been delighted to meet any one who had friends at home Although I have had a number of happy experiences and met many people I always feel that my enjoyment would have been greatly enhanced had I but had the society of old friends from home I am now at the Australian Corps School and am commanding the second division wing I\\nhave another officer to assist me also four Sergeant Instructors This is my first course\\nhere and incidentally my first experience in teaching You should be here to give me a\\nhelping hand We have 65 students 20 of which are officers and 45 NCOs As this\\ncourse lasts for five weeks you will see that much work has to be done Being new to the game I had myself working pretty hard every night preparing the\\ntraining for the next day Next course I should say things will be much easier I like the\\nwork alright and am getting quite interested There is much competition of course\\nbetween Divisions to win the cups presented at the end of each course One is for\\naggregates one for musketry another for sports My Division at present holds the Sports\\ncup and are going really well this time I have hopes that one or perhaps both of the\\nothers may also be secured We are at present on the spot where portion of the British line was held in July 1916\\nwhere the long Somme offensive commenced Within quite easy walking distance is the\\nfamous battle field sacred to Australia where it was that I first took a hand in this gentle\\ngame of war It is generally considered that never since that eventful July and August\\nhave we been under anything nearly so hot I am sure there will be thousands of\\nAustralians who will make a pilgrimage to this place after the war It would be a grand\\nthing if a particular area could be granted to the Australian Government which I believe\\ntoo is quite possible I am wonderfully fit and well and to my shame say that in these days of food shortages I\\nam getting fat I do not know how to start this letter The circumstances are different from any under which I ever wrote before I am not to post it but will leave it in my pocket if anything happens to me someone will perhaps post it We are going over the top this afternoon and only God in Heaven knows who will come out of it alive I am in his hands and whatever happens I will look to him in this world and the world to come If I am called my regret is that I leave you and my bairns I go to him with your dear face the last vision on earth I shall see and your name upon my lips you the best of women You will look after by Darling Bairns for me and tell them how their daddy died h How I love you all and as I sit here waiting I wonder what you are doing at home I must not do that It is hard enough sitting waiting We may move at any minute When this reaches you for me there will be no more war only eternal peace and waiting for you It is a legacy of struggle for you but God will look after you and we shall meet again when there will be no more parting I am to write no more sweetheart Kiss the Bairns for me once more I dare not think of them my Darlings Goodbye you best of women and best of wives my beloved sweetheart May God in his mercy look over you and bless you all May he in that same mercy preserve me today Eternal love  Just a few lines dear to tell you I am still in the land of the living and keeping well trusting you are the same dear I have just received your letter dear and was very pleased to get it It came rather more punctual this time for it only took five days We are not in the same place dear in fact we dont stay in the same place very long we are having very nice weather at present dear and I hope it continues Fondest love and kisses from your I was so delighted to get your letter this morning and know you are quite alright I am pleased to say I am alright myself and hope dear this will find you the same I was so pleased to hear darling that you had such a nice enjoyable evening It was quite a treat I am sure I dont suppose you do get much amusement I am glad you are getting my letters dear I am not waiting until I get your letters dear now before I write because it would make it so long for you to wait for a letter and I guess you are pleased to get as many as possible I can understand darling your not being able to write as frequently I shall get used to waiting for your letters soon I guess but at first it seems so strange after being used to having them so regularly\\n Well darling I dont know any more to say now and I am feeling sleepy Oh I wish you were here darling but its no good wishing Fondest love and lots of kisses from Yes I have got used to the puttees as they have shaped to my legs by now And I am getting used to my other things now as I have been dished out with a rifle and bayonet and now when I go on parade I have got to wear my belt bayonet and cartridge pouch and also take the rifle They have been teaching us bayonet fighting today and I can tell you it makes your arms ache when you make a point that is when you lunge out at imaginary enemy with the rifle at arms length I think with this hard training they will either make a man of me or kill me You ought to see me in my Shrapnel Helmet and Gas Mask it would make you laugh especially as the helmet wobbles from side to side every time I walk Yes I got my food alright and you can have supper if you like to go for it and you can bet I always go for supper I am taking your advice and eating all I can Yes I did remember Dollys birthday and I have sent her a little badge of my Regiment which she asked for and which I expect you have received by now You will have to tell Miss Farmer that I think she will have to wait another two months before she sees me on leave I will see the officer about the allowance in a day or so as I have heard today that two or three boys mothers are receiving an allowance but I dont know how much Well I think I will have to close now As I havent anything more to say just at present Hoping you are quite well  It is a strange feeling to me but a very real one that every letter now that I write home to you or to the little sisters may be the last that I shall write or you read I do not want you to think that I am depressed indeed on the contrary I am very cheerful But out here in odd moments the realisation comes to me of how close death is to us A week ago I was talking with a man a catholic from\\xa0Preston who had been out here for nearly four years untouched He was looking forward with certainty to going on leave soon And now he is dead  killed in a moment during our last advance Well it was Gods will I say this to you because I hope that you will realise as I do the possibility of the like happening to myself I feel very glad myself that I can look the fact in the face without fear or misgiving Much as I hope to live thro it all for your sakes and my little sisters I am quite prepared to give my life as so many have done before me All I can do is put myself in Gods hands for him to decide and you and the little ones pray for me to the Sacred Heart and Our Lady I hope that you will not move out of the old house yet Write and let me know when anything happens I see that you went to Preston a few days ago It seems years and years since I tried to get drowned in the canal\\n With my dear love Pray for me Now barring accidents you will get to know all about it I know you will have a big surprise when you get this letter  I hope it lands without mishap If anybody in authority was to see it  Of course you have guessed by now where I had my first experience of the line Yes it was on the Ypres salient Oh it was a lovely baptism of fire that night We had to dig ourselves in and early in the morning Fritz started straffing Oh Lord if ever a fellow was afraid absolutely frightened to death it was this child Then one of my Section took shell shock when a big un dropped a couple of yards off the parapet and then the instinct of the leader or one whose place it is to lead came to the top and I became as cool and steady as a rock I had twelve men when we went in I came out with three Oh it was ghastly Perhaps you would like to know something of the spirit of the men out here now Well the truth is and as I said before Id be shot if anyone of importance collared this missive every man Jack is fed up almost past bearing and not a single one has an ounce of what we call patriotism left in him Noone cares a rap whether Germany has Alsace Belgium or France too for that matter All that every man desires now is to get done with it and go home Now thats the honest truth and any man who has been out within the last few months will tell you the same In fact and this is no exaggeration the greatest hope of a great majority of the men is that rioting and revolt at home will force the government to pack in on any terms Now youve got the real state of affairs right from the horses mouth as it were I may add that I too have lost pretty nearly all the patriotism that I had left its just the thought of you all over there you who love and trust me to do my share of the job that is necessary for your safety and freedom Its just that that keeps me going and enables me to stick it As for religion God forgive us all it hasnt a place in one out of a million of the thoughts that hourly occupy mens mind God bless you darling and all those I love and who love me for without their love and trust I would faint and fail But dont worry dear heart o mine for I shall carry on to the end be it bitter or sweet with my loved ones ever my first thought and care my guide inspirations and spur\\n u revoir my own sweetheart and God will keep you safe till the storms over with all my hearts deepest love Your own loving  As long as you kept your head down you were comparatively safe so as it went on this was where I had my first escape I was on sentry duty for a couple of hours from 1am to 3am and was instructed to keep a sharp look out I did not care for the idea of keeping my head above the trench and looking for beastly Germans however it had to be done it was quite uncanny to watch the enemy trench which appeared somewhat like a black wave and only sixty yards in front then you would suddenly see the flash of their rifles and machine guns immediately after would come the report and nasty thuds on the sandbags which you might be resting against I fired about five shots at their flashes the only target to aim at then another two shells which lodged in the parapet either side of my head leaving about 2 to 3 inches between me and certain death I thought that near enough but it turned out that it was to have something nearer than that Our casualties here amounted on the average to about two per day killed of course we thought it terrible at the time at least I did Early April saw us relieved by another division and we were sent a few miles back for a wellearned rest which consisted of physical drill and a run before breakfast The remainder of the morning being spent in platoon drill musketry drills After dinner we put the cap on our rest why so called I do not know by having a route march for two hours We spent a few days like this and were dispatched with all possible speed to Ypres here we went in to support the Canadians and spent a most unpleasant eight days during which time we lost several hundred men nearly all my friends who came out in the same draft and were killed or wounded we had to retire the best part being that the Germans did not find this out until two days after when we were more or less safely bivouacking in a very pretty wood We stayed here for about a week then we got to work again digging reserve trenches just behind the front line building up parapets which had been demolished by the enemys high explosive shells and such like working all night and getting what sleep we could in the daytime One morning we were awakened by the most awful din it seemed as though hell had broken loose shells were falling like summer rain And people have often told me in the course of conversation it was raining shells and I admit I took it with a grain of salt could not be possible I thought but such I was surprised to find was possible and actually taking place there about 330am This bombardment started and about half an hour later I with three others were ordered to start reinforcing We went up in fours it being considered safer that way half a mile over open ground we had to do this being swept continually with shells to give you a slight idea I can say the previous night just in front of our reserve trenches was a beautifully green field and the next morning it was as much as one could do to see any grass at all simply one mass of craters varying in diameter from ten to twelve paces I had gone about half the required distance when a shell fell only a yard from where I was the force of the concussion explosion pitched me several yards to my left and I came down rather heavily however I reached the first line without any further mishap where we had to stay until midnight when we had to be relieved again owing to not having enough me to hold the trench Our honours were one VC Victoria Cross two DSO Distinguished Service Orders one Military Cross and one or two DCM Distinguished Conduct Medals The next day I paraded sick my back paining me so much that I could not stand straight for a week after I am now back with the regiment who are on the line of communications We are having leave shortly and if possible will pay a visit to the Audit office Have you any news of Chichester Have just come through a particularly nasty period We went into the trenches on Wednesday night and on Sunday morning at 5am our Artillery commenced bombarding the German trenches and after 20 minutes had elapsed we went over the parapet My goodness what a reception the Huns had in store for us they simply swept the ground with machine gun fire and shrapnel It was found impossible to make any advance in our quarter so I dug myself in and awaited events It was horrible suspense as I seemed to be the only man untouched all around me and being personally acquainted with each man made matters worse in fact its all wrong to call them men as they were mostly mere boys About early afternoon I was hailed from the trench as to whether it was possible for me to get back I replied in the affirmative and decided to run the risk of getting potted on the way So I commenced crawling on my stomach until about a few yards from the parapet then made a spring and rushed headlong over the top nearly spoiling the features of a few who happened to be in the trench and were not expecting me We were relieved that afternoon but some of the fellows did not get in until nightfall and these experienced another bombardment Billy Hastings is quite fit and the only pal left We have been resting since but by all reports we shall be up again soon No rest for the wicked it is said and if true we must surely be a bad lot What a terrible thing about the Lusitania and with so many Americans aboard Should imagine there will be more trouble Have received box and letter dated 6th and am most thankful for everything you are all doing for me As regards the pads masks of cotton pads which served as gas masks all we were served out with were made on the spot and consisted of a piece of gauze and tape and were steeped in a solution of bicarbonate of soda prior to this charge I lost all my belongings except the Gillette razor so should be glad of a few toilet requisites when next you are sending a parcel Do not trouble about towel and perhaps Frank would get me a shaving brush Must now close Much love to all I am much nearer the front now and we moved here last Tuesday It was a long march and of course done at night and our present billet is a farm or the remains of one in a large village about ¾ mile from the trenches more north than we were before and nearer the Belgian frontier It is an awfully desolate spot and constantly under shell fire This morning I was trying to get a sleep on the grass when a shell burst in a tree not fifty yards away and sent a shower of leaves to the ground Fortunately no one was hit another burst in the same field ten minutes afterwards then I thought it was time to shift So went into a barn There are a number of dugouts around but they are so cold and you might get buried inside The farm is a vile place with a lot of stagnant water around and a lot of German soldiers are buried here The barn where we sleep would be improved if a shell struck the roof and ventilated it in our absence As the smell inside is bad and makes it nearly necessary to wear a respirator The rats seem to object to our company as they often have a free fight on top of us Last night was my first experience in the trenches and we returned to billet this morning The din is simply awful and just lately the big guns have been giving the enemy beans every night I am glad to say we had no casualties although the rifle fire was heard at times especially on our left where the Germans made an attack on the Indian troops The British gun fire was simply terrific all night and the Germans did not reply very much It was fine to watch the flashes of our guns at our backs although the screaming of the shells overhead is at first rather scaring to say the least of it However the news we hear from day to day at this part of the front is very cheerful and encouraging Yesterday I came across an Indian soldier who could speak English very well and he thought another month would see the war over also a German officer captured near here said it could not go on very much longer I for one hope these remarks will prove correct The church here is practically demolished just some of the walls and tower standing and the churchyard is in a bad state Great holes have been made and bones exposed In these holes is water sufficiently deep to drown anybody Great stone vaults have been opened and coffins and bodies can be seen Of course the place here is not inhabited except by soldiers I have been through some of the big houses and plenty of good carved furniture pictures fittings etc still remain in them I also have been in some of the gardens and roses just coming into bloom can be seen in great numbers I should like to see them at home Well I must close now and hope you are all keeping well Again thanking you all for our good wishes\\n My dear mother\\xa0It is Sunday again and mothers day at that so Ill have to take the Chaplains advice and write to my mother We were all at services this afternoon and he gave us quite a nice talk on our duties in writing home as often as we possibly could Sunday is about the only day we have in which to write anymore for by the time we finish our work during the weekdays we are either too tired or have no time to do it We took advantage of it being Sunday morning and didnt get up till 8 oclock Had a good breakfast of hotcakes bacon coffee and doughnuts We still have plenty of good food and one of the cooks is a pastry cook so we get doughnuts and cake every day or so We get our dinner in the field now prepared in those army field kitchens The stuff is cooked as the rig is pulled along the road It has been raining most of the time this week and is trying hard to do it today This is a great asparagus country around here for they have acres and acres of it The rows are hilled up like they used to fix the mud grafts in the nursery They cut it off about 6 or 8 inches below the ground just after the top shows for they wont use it after it has come up and turned green They certainly keep their fields clean and put in lots of hard work on it The girls do all or most of the work now that the men are away Two of us have an invitation out to supper tonight with a family near here and expect to have a good time The people are all very hospitable here and will do almost anything for us Just a wee note I am going over the parapet and the chances of a sub getting back alive are abut nix If I do get back why you can give me the horse laugh If not thisll let you know that I kicked out with my boots on So cheer up old dear and dont let the newspapers use you as material for a Saturdaymagazine\\nfeature You know the kind where the sweetfaced greyhaired little mother clutching the last\\nletter from her boy to her breast sobbed He was such a fine lad as she furtively brushed the\\nglistening tears from her eyes with a dish rag etc etc Im going to tell you this in case my company commander forgets Your son is a soldier and a\\ndoggone good one too if he does say it himself as shouldnt And if he gets pipped itll be doing\\nhis blooming job In a way its darned funny All the gang are writing post mortem letters and kind of half ashamed\\nof themselves for doing it As one of our officers said If I mail it and come through the show\\nIll be a joke If I tear it up and get killed Ill be sorry I didnt send it  This is the first day they have allowed us to write letters since this battle began and I have no doubt you are anxious to hear from me Well we have lost an awful lot of our fellows and to those of us who are left it seems just a miracle that any of us came through alive How I did not get hit I do not know but I was one of the lucky ones that got through it without a\\nscratch although I got several bullet holes through my clothes About two brigades of Canadians held about five times as many Germans It would have done\\nyou good to see the boys I did not see one show the white feather but each had a set face and\\nwent right at it We held the Germans and charged them back until they started to use that awful gas and they\\nforced the French on our left to retreat So we had to retreat too or we would have been cut right\\noff  It was just a nightmare a hell retreating across the ground with the Jack Johnsons digging great\\nholes and the shrapnel raining down upon us and the bullets striking everywhere We could see\\nthe boys falling everywhere and it was just awful to hear them cry out  Thank goodness the Artillery and English reinforcements came up when they did and drove the\\nGermans off Our machine gun sergeant is to be recommended for the VC He sure is a brave man and he is\\nvery badly wounded Our machine gun wiped out hundreds of Germans Poor Tom Smith of Cobourg Tom is gone I am very sorry for Mrs Bolster but Major Bolster\\ndied a brave death He was the last of his company to leave the trench and he had a smile on his\\nface We have lost two of our guns and there are only eleven of us left out of the section Well all the\\nboys did the best they could and I for one am ready to do it again only I hope the war will soon\\nend for the sake of the poor parents wives and sweethearts of all the soldiers Still I thank God that I am spared and always pray that He will soon end the war  I thought I should write to let you know Im safe and Im recovering I miss you and the rest give everyone a hug from me and tell Rosie I hope shes being good The hospital is constantly got new soldiers coming in suffering from nervous exhaustion and\\nshell shock too so Im not the only one the doctor said it is an injury to the nerves and told me to\\nrest and they are putting in place electric shock treatment All the nurses are very sympathetic\\nbut sometimes when they think we cant hear them they call us all weak and say we are cowards Im not suffering as much as most a young gentleman has been learning to walk again yet he still\\nwants to get back to the frontline Yes I am returning to the frontline soon so thats why I took\\nthis opportunity to write We had strict orders not to take prisoners no matter if wounded my first job was when I had\\nfinished cutting some of their wire away to empty my magazine on 3 germans that came out of\\none of their deep dugouts they was bleeding badly begging for them to be put out of their misery\\nThey cried for mercy but I had my orders they had no feeling what so ever for us  it makes my\\nhead jump to think about it One time I was in serious danger I was almost completely paralysed with fear I was sitting with\\nTaylor a fellow soldier on the firestep of a trench during an intense bombardment when it\\nseemed certain that we must be killed at any moment Shots fired around us each moment\\nthreatened to be the last I was conscious of biting the fabric on my top to prevent my teeth from\\nchattering If I had been alone on that occasion I believe that I would be dead now it was the\\npresence of others that saved me Since the last letter that was written directly from the battle under heavy shelling and infantry fire it has constantly continued that way  there is no word for it And not for that which followed Shooting slashing stabbing bashing It all took half an hour as the clock showed afterwards\\nwhen things had calmed down There were no more Russians only corpses a few ragged\\ndreadfully trembling prisoners otherwise all dead Heaps Heaps The first lines moved in with hand grenades behind them with rifle and bayonet behind them \\nunbelievable Unbelievable Multitudes with clubs and axes certainly only to finish us off like\\ncattle those of us who had escaped the other weapons alive and were still breathing Dogs Dogs They had not yet known Prussian soldiers Certainly not There was no more\\nmercy I have never experienced such a thing never want to experience it again and will never speak of\\nit again Oh Wife Oh love Be strong Be brave It is all going well Surely Post even arrived yesterday\\nmorning I have just come in from a trip to the Orpheus by my lonesome The movie expresses my feelings to a T My it feels strange to be so near  and yet you might as well be 1000 miles away tonight I kind of hope against hope that when I turn a corner it may be to run into you Do I sound foolish you ask Isnt that what I used to say in my letters of last year Well Im there tonight whether foolish or otherwise What have you been doing today I supposed the same old studying I hope you practised hard for you just have to come out away up in your exams or you neednt tell me how you get along at all One chap has just come in the room feeling a little better than good if you know what that means and is trying to get into bed It is just the sort of thing to make one think and wonder how men came make such fools of themselves  I guess it is up to me to go over and take his clothes off now How strange it is I have to contrast it with my own case I have had a well I can almost say enjoyable evening at the show had an ice cream on the way up  the whole thing costing me about 25 cents  and now I am happy writing to you And the morrow what of it In all likelihood a grand day and I trust ending up with my little sweetheart and a kiss that I can feel now Have I not much to be thankful for Am I not lucky And should not my life show this good fortune if I may call it so in many ways There are some questions for you to help me in solving I often ponder over them and can only see one course ahead Well well Helen where am I taking you Away off into philosophy I suppose you will call it I venture to call it Life The grand the noble the fascinating problem of living Sometimes you know I think that I could be happy yes truly happy away off far from the bother of human uproar hidden away in some place of grandeur alone with you You have pictured it to me and I can see it but no dearie that would not be true happiness Im sure we would both tire of it in a very short while It would be gorgeous and lovely for a time but I think there would be a longing for a something that was not there I like sometimes to think of a different scene perhaps two pictures the first of a room filled with books and all the necessities of a library and you and I reading together Alice in Wonderland We are both tired for it is after a strenuous day and oh how we are enjoying it and are happy as happy can be Now honey Ive written in a very peculiar sheen but it is so long since I have written you and so much has happened since my last letter that I forget what you like me to say what you want me to say and what I want to say myself One thing I do remember you want me to put down in cold blue ink and even in blood so Ill try not to tease but feel the truth and say that I love you still First and most important I suppose that you have heard the news This time I think that it is sure and that we will be on the water some time this side of Sunday That is about all I can think of at present It does not seem possible after so many disappointments that we are really going The boys seem to be going crazy by tomorrow there will be no holding them There is to be a parade of every man in the battery then and the news will come to us officially My it is so long since I have seen you and so long since I promised to write you and again so long since talking with you that it is hard to find much to write about Writing is at its heart but a very poor apology for speech and when I think that it will be but a short time till I can tell you all the news my pen fails in its attempt to note down what I will only repeat on Friday if not sooner '"

       "'Dear wife my two kids and all my family I will tell you that I have reached Magnac and we are leaving for Paris next Thursday to go to the border of Germany I will tell you that since Sunday I have not eaten two cents of food when at the moment I have 50000000 ideas in my head but anyway I am not sick I will tell you that we arrested a German spy and I guarantee you that he is not at the end of his sentences There are three spies who were executed but not in Magnac very close to Paris this is the last letter I am writing to you because afterwards I think that I will not be able anymore or if I rewrite it will be when I get to Paris At the moment it seems that things are going badly but I will fight to the end for the honor of all to save you if I can and all my comrades I promised you almost solemnly to tell you the truth I will do it but on the other hand you gave me the assurance that you would have strong nerves and a firm heart I have been since this morning in conquered trenches for 2 days all of these trenches and guts forms a real labyrinth where I wandered 3 hours last night absolutely lost The traces of the ardent struggle are numerous and striking and first of all they are more than half destroyed by the hurricane of grape shot that our artillery threw there so they are inconvenient and horribly dirty in spite of the urgent repairs which we made there everything is missing water clean or dirty hoses latrines they are less than 200 meters from the 1st enemy line with which they communicate by sealed guts they are strewn with French and German corpses without almost disturbing me I counted 20 frozen in the most macabre attitudes This neighborhood is not yet foulsmelling but it still hurts the eyes this morning at 5 oclock we arrived wet and exhausted and I entered the first shelter to relax I noticed a good board lay down on it found it soft but 5 minutes later I noticed that she made a bedstead on 2 German corpses well believe me it still does something at least the first time We are cooking loudly all around us and it really is sometimes a din already I hardly greet any more The evil is not there it is especially in the weather which is dreadful For at least 3 days gusts of rain have followed showers the guts are unspeakable quagmires where one slips where one gets dreadfully muddy so I am superlative at least to the waist my hands are muddy and will remain so until departure my shoes are full of water fortunately the body is dry for the air is almost cold and the sky livid Around me people are making a face It will take a lot of patience and moraleWe are wearing the new sheet steel helmet it is heavy and inconvenient but it gives serious protection against bursts of fusants and against ricochets so one carries it without grumbling We also have a lot of gear against asphyxiating gases But we will be poorly supplied only one meal at night which will usually arrive cold and this is explained both by the length of the guts and by the difficulty of traversing a large uncovered area To this somewhat dark but true picture two corrective measures should be added first we will have a defensive role we are responsible for rehabilitating the very upset sector then the Germans counterattacked little owing to the lack of manpower and the state of their affairs in Champagne For these 2 reasons it may very well be that we do not have to look them in the eye this is also the unanimous wish here My letter will reach you in the midst of a period of resettlement and worries I will try to take my part from afar it will distract me and merge me a little more with you I wish you calm and courage to triumph over these small difficulties You know how much I love you and what tender kisses I send you share with our dear little ones I absolutely approve of your decision regarding Catherines kind offer My Daddy Mom Little Sister join me in wishing you a happy new year and good health and hugging you with all our heart Last year  that day I had the joy of kissing you but this year a Cursed Character took this happiness away from me but having your photograph I cover it with my tenderest kisses with the firm hope that you will return to us safe and sound this Victory year after having accomplished the most sacred of Duties towards our beloved Fatherland Today Saturday I am writing to let you know that we are still in Magnac at this time We are not yet all dressed because in the regiment that we are going to form which is the 90th territorial we are several classes 95969798 and 99 who is me of the youngest The reserve of active like us was made up of several classes They left around Paris while we are told that we are leaving on Monday without knowing the direction Everything remains secret some say that we are even going to Africa to replace the troops which have returned others to La Rochelle or to Paris in the forts It is even said that we are going to harvest in Champagne and that is where we are going to drink good wine I saw Lucien the same day in the evening that had just arrived Were pretty much done dressing  we dressed as we liked no one told us anything We lay down in the straw and sleep then we eat like pigs We could each go to sleep at home while we wait for the order to leave Me Im in the 12th company There are still two or three active army reserve classes to return which will pass us on the way We are good people and do not have bad blood because if you see us we hardly worry we I am writing to you lying on the grass coming out of a nap Dont worry and see you soon  Dear Mother and Brother All I recommend to you is to take care of my two children as well as the beloved Margueritte As long as me do not count on me anymore because we are going to a butchers shop human My last thought for my mother my wife and my two children as well as all my family whom I once loved so much and will always love as long as I see you from afar We must hope that one day we will be in the space of the sun Kiss my little ones very hard for me At the 338th of Magnac Laval I will tell you that we are a lot of Saint Junien If you want to reply write as soon as you receive my letter Dont be bored Bravery I hope to bring a Prussian helmet Farewell Long live France I am still in good health Im not running any risk Men are still digging trenches and gutters Since yesterday we left our bivouac to go to a cantonment closer to the front We are with artillerymen hunters on horseback engineers on foot and hussars We are much better than in tents We have to go to rest on June 5th I find pretty much anything I want do not send money or parcel to me before I ask you to The area is still calm we work all day and only hear a few hits from 75 I want to tell you that the Germans can attack where we are The unfortunate ones they are well awaited You cant imagine everything that has been done since the war such as trenches machine gun shelters and gunslingers As much as it comes so much will be left For their part it may be the same No more nothing new Your son who loves you  I come to ask you how you are and if you have any news from Louis I have been isolated for 5 weeks in the middle of dirty and disgusting limousins who treat us as real German prisoners I lead an idle life and get away from it all I hope to have the pleasure of returning to the north soon before being designated to leave for the fields because I have number 3 and it could happen at some point to the other In any case I cannot regret this region in any way and anywhere I can go I will be happy to go because here it is really good to wonder if it is still France   Im not complaining about military life at the moment We could certainly get better but alas there are much worse too Please God that we emerge victorious from this terrible hour and that your husband and mine join their homes intact from the struggle Your devoted cousin  My dear adored I am writing to you on my bag in the trenches we have been there day and night for 9 days The Zouaves the tirailleurs and the blacks have arrived They tried to move forward by crossing by means of a bridge the canal from Nieggport to Ypres which is in front of us at 5 minutes but the enemy is there at 700m which sends them heavy fire 17 Zouaves fall and are forced to retreat I cannot tell you how long we will stay here Mouhaud de Saingnemousoude was killed in a ombat on October 22 we have 12 dead in the regiment we were in the 1st line Eugene Thomas has a cut finger he is evicted The dirty boches bombard all the churches especially I do not see any more newspapers I do not know how it goes elsewhere we knew in spite of that the success of the Russian army I cant wait for them to arrive in Berlin because its starting to take a long time Im still in good health and I think the same is true of you our friends and all the family You tell me that you are going to go to the country maybe you have left I received your letter on the 29th I will send the letter to Paris if you are gone the concierge will do it well if we could not do it You could stay in Laprugne often as often as possible It is claimed that the war will end in Belgium it is a flat country but we have been facing the enemy for 10 days and we have not been able to dislodge them I do not need anything at the moment I have a knit that I have touched with the company I still have money When I need something Ill tell you We drink water when we find it or beer but there is no more Wine is very rare It is worth 1 franc 75 a bottle but where the Germans have spent there is nothing left With money you can have nothing We are the 1st territorial fire there must be a question of politics I dont know if well be left there You will write to me as often as you can Instead of Magnac Laval you will put military center I end by hugging you and the whole family with all my heart If you havent left hello friends The German shells pass over our heads and will explode backwards a few bullets from time to time our artillery responds to them You will have to arrange to receive your allowance in the country not to give it to them I wrote my letter yesterday I will try to make it leave I will free it at 0 francs 25 you will tell me if it was there because we are still in the trenches the airplanes pass and are attacked by the German army without touching them The weather is fine but its a funny Halloween Give me news of your brothers and Gaston Your father still hasnt answered me This is not cheerful because we are very poorly supplied but you have to be courageous two planes have just shot at each other without hitting each other It is the first German plane that we see He fired 15 cannon shots without being hit  Dear parents I arrived in Croissy it was around 7 am planes It made a terrible thunderstorm and there was plenty of water falling without being able to find any shelter It didnt last long but the short time it got us wet anyway However we had some dry effects to change us Today it did not rain on the contrary the weather was fine We are fairly well quartered We have straw in suufisance and I believe that we will stay there Goodbye dear parents My dear Ginette I am writing to tell you that I have known death up close that night but now everything is fine I have seen my whole life pass before my eyes Due to shellfire in my trench the alcove where I slept collapsed two of my comrades died in the collapse I got a beam on my leg my leg got infected and the doctors had to cut my leg off Now I dont risk anything anymore because they transferred me outside the combat zone I can tell you that I am happy to have left this hell with the rats the lice the crabs the mud the macabés the artillery fire of all kinds Even if I told you in my previous letters its horrible here the smell of his comrades who have been dead for three days But despite all this misfortune and all this hatred I keep thinking of you you Ginette You light up my heart like the sun rising on the battlefield still smoking from the shells of the day before What could my Darling your little husband find more agreeable than to be able to write you a little note in this sad situation to tell you all my dear ones that in this day I am still well and at the same time as always I hope and desire with all my heart that you all enjoy very good health Peace does not come quickly on our poor land overthrown by modern science turned into unbridled barbarism Finally let us always have the hope that this dreadful calamity will end like everything else in this world Last night I did not get my good letter Tonight I look forward to it Time does not pass quickly enough My beloved Valentine I still hope so Ah how happy I will be when I will be near you forever Courage and hope Heart always beautiful I end for today my dear ones by kissing you wholeheartedly How I love you Your dear little one who loves you very much hugging my darling little wife  My Darling this morning I received a letter from you dated 3 It gave me great pleasure to know that you are in excellent health For me its still going very well but tonight Im sorry I thought I was going to finish today but I was unlucky In the morning we had 2 devices to shoot and they were both broken then after noon to make matters worse it rained all evening so we couldnt fly Provided that the weather is fine tomorrow because I have had enough of this country then I cant wait to see you again Finally I hope the weather will be fine and that I can finish quickly so that I can be near you on Saturday or Sunday morning In this hope I end by kissing you very hard and for a long time on your beloved mouth  Yesterday throughout the journey the people in a hurry at level crossings and stations did not stop cheering us the women sending kisses the men taking over with us the Marseillaise and the Chant du Départ Why Must a deaf anguish take hold of my heart If it were in operation it would be very amusing but here it is the day after tomorrow in 3 days perhaps the bullets will rain and who knows was not going to come back if I was going to kill my mother murder my mother on purpose Oh whats in store for me Sorry mom I should have stayed working my cello for you for you who made so many sacrifices for a little mother already sick  You cannot get an idea my dear how unhappy we are so yet I am not too used to complaining but this time I have to because it is one thing beyond the imaginable it is not to be able to say to you In this tunnel we are an affair of 3000 men in reserve in a humidity because the water trickles all along the walls and there However we have to sleep there on the railway line We go to look for food in the middle of the night near Verdun accompanied all along the way by the shells which means that we can only have one meal a day and without soup To get to the front lines it is very painful and very dangerous about a kilometer before arriving there is a passage called the ravine of death who knows the men that there is killed in there you have to go through it there is no other place  I will tell you that we refused to line up on Tuesday night we did not want to march we almost went on strike and many other regiments did as we did You know if it is clean  When I go in perme I will tell you better They take us for animals make us walk like that and not much to eat and still get smashed to nothing we would have mounted the attack it would have remained half of it and we would not have advanced for that Well I dont know what will become of it things are going very badly for the moment May be that you will not receive my letter they will perhaps open them and those where we tell what is happening they will keep them or burn them  I dont care I dont care have had enough of their war  My sweet Therese I havent written to you for a few days but you see here in the trenches its cold My fingers are numb its barely if I can still handle my rifle The living conditions for soldiers like me have become unbearable Every second we have to fight against hunger cold sleep and fear Because yes we are afraid Fear of seeing Germans appear at any time The interior of the trenches is muddy This mud is found everywhere even in the bread that we eat once youve touched it It also tastes quite unpleasant But we are not allowed to be choosy since food is increasingly scarce Rats have also invaded our trenches They are huge and even uglier than the ones I have seen on the farm And more wicked Not long ago they killed a dog and ate it Killing has become a habit for me Its horrible to say but its the truth These three years of war have made monsters of me and all my companions Great battles such as the one at Verdun last year which claimed more than 680000 lives are clear proof of this We have all given up hope that this massacre will ever end When I left even if leaving you was heartbreaking for me I was smiling because I believed the State when it told us that it would only be a matter of months that we would quickly come back to find our little one quiet life All the soldiers believed him The point is its the third Christmas Im going to be away from you and more than half of the men Ive gone with have already died They all had parents friends family some were even fathers They will never see their loved ones again And all these children will grow up alone because their father left to die for the homeland But the state is guilty of an even bigger lie One of our comrades returned from leave a few weeks ago He brought us some newspapers to show us what civilians are told about the war Enemy bullets would have no effect on us And the neighbors son then how did he die Another article also spoke of Verdun precisely So that way the shelters had all the necessary comforts such as heating or electricity According to the soldier when he wanted to contradict this collection of lies the civilians did not believe him They were convinced that what was written is none other than the truth How can it be so I hope you are not one of those people or that this letter will change your mindSome of my companions because they could not live far from their families without seeing their children grow up resorted to voluntary mutilation Our superiors noticed this and these soldiers will be shot this evening How can the state do this All these soldiers are fighting for men in higher positions who themselves stay warm by developing pseudostrategies However at the slightest sign of weakness as soon as the desire to stop killing is felt the government does not hesitate to kill these soldiers when they are men from its homeland who would have been ready to give their lives for France Let them take care of the damn Boches who duck us from morning to night It is like the affair of the martyrs of Vingré These poor men were guilty of nothing except for wanting to escape the enemy You must be wondering why I am telling you all this today when in my previous letters I had it seem to be happy Heres the reason censorship is watching She reads every letter of ours and as soon as a letter is a little pessimistic it is destroyed The government makes you believe that we are going to win this war that the soldiers die happy for their homeland that we always have our fill and that we do not suffer from the cold This is all wrong and I want you to know the truth But I know you will receive this letter because the bakers son has permission I asked him to give you this letter Can you thank him by cooking something for him Youve always had a knack for cooking Hope our son is doing well I have only seen him twice since he was born I hope I will have another permission soon to be able to visit you These days away from you two are getting more and more unbearable All my love in this letter for you and our child My dear mother I will probably surprise you by telling you that it was almost without regret that I left Paris but it is the truth What do you want I noticed like all my comrades that these two years of war had gradually brought about selfishness and indifference among the civilians and that we combatants were almost forgotten I will therefore try to forget how I have been forgotten it will certainly be more difficult and yet I had had a very nice dream for two years What a desappointment  Now I will feel good alone May the hazards of war not cripple me forever rather death is now my only hope Dear Marie I am writing two letter words to tell you that follows in good health and I want my letter to find you all too I am still in the hospital but not for long if I had stayed for 15 days I would have had a leave of 6 days I dont know where it comes from I write every day and I dont get reply I look forward to hearing from you soon I see much more to say for today I end by kissing you with all my heart Good morning to you all  Very dear husband I am writing you these few lines to give you our news which is always very good for the moment the whole family is like this and I think that my letter to you will find the same We received your letter on Tuesday which gives us great pleasure to hear from you which I expected every day We received Panorama tones on Friday The little ones were very happy is your little girl who talks every day about her daddy who is very cute My dear Antoine I received my allowances on Saturday evening at 3 am twenty francs from January 15th But if you need anything then let me know Belugeon gave me 3 bushels of clover 3 days since the cows were out of the field Every day it rains a lot and its cold its a bad weather I cant see much more to say to you but dont get bad blood on us you can rest easy now I end my letter by kissing you with all my heart many times Your wife Good morning from all the family  Dear Mr Welsh We were only out here a matter of a few hours before we went into the trenches we were there for eight days and then came on to what is called a Rest Camp I suppose it is called that to distinguish it from the trenches because the men are at work all day road and trench making and it comes under both rifle and artillery fire We got here at 7 oclock yesterday morning and were shelled at 9 oclock In the trenches it was fairly bad they are so narrow and smelly and one is being potted at and shelled all the time A turn of eight days was really quite long enough because it is strenuous work and even when you do turn in for a rest you have to be ready to turn out at once on an alarm The country is really quite pretty and just like the hills and valleys of South Wales but there are no brooks or rivers It rains hard for a month each year usually about this time and then there is no more until the next rainy season But although it is so gloriously sunny something is wrong with the place and it really isnt as healthy as it looks I think the flies have something to do with it as well as the heat and the still unburied dead bodies about There are millions and millions of flies here and they are all over everything Put a cup of tea down without a cover and it is immediately covered with dead ones they are all round your mouth and directly you open it to speak or to eat in they pop It is a game We have all got nets of course we should have been worried no medicine by now if we hadnt We get plenty of bully beef and army biscuits but bread and fresh meat is still a luxury and it is not possible to buy anything It must have been a No Mans Land because there are no houses or buildings of any kind to be seen and except the flies the only living things are green canaries and lizards We live in dugouts built up the reverse sides of the hills They are just holes really but all the same they can be made very comfortable with a bit of digging and a few waterproof sheets They are not shell proof by any means and the one I slept in during my first night here was knocked in completely by a shell pitching right into it Fortunately I was not at home at the time We have another now and I must try and get a photo of it and let you see what it is like I must send you one of our Mess dugout too Everything here is named after the Regiment responsible for the making or taking For instance the road we made from our trenches to this camp is called New Bedford Rd and the ridge we took and now occupy is called on the army maps Bedford Ridge I have just been filling in and colouring my map and find it is one of the most if not the most advanced line of the lot Standing on that ridge it is possible to see what a lot of country we have taken and now hold but there is nothing to get wildly excited about Each position is strengthened as much as possible before another attempt is made to push on and the whole thing is just steady progress Something might happen suddenly I only hope it does We have had some very big ships out here and they have been bombarding the forts heavily now for some few days and there are cruisers monitors etc standing in the bay helping the land batteries to shell the trenches You see a flash and then wait a long time before hearing the boom and the shriek of the shell passing over our heads almost together then look round quickly and see the burst of the shell in or over the trenches sometimes before hearing the explosion The first we know of shells aimed at us is the bang of the explosion and it is too late to get out of the way Three officers were laid flat on their backs the other day without any hurt except to their dignity and farther on six men were buried without one being injured It isnt always like that though There is quite good bathing here when we can find time to go As the beach is in full view of the enemy and comes under their shell fire it would not appeal to the nervous We never keep closer together than ten yards when we are undressing and swimming in hopes that the Turk will not consider one man worth the price of a shell We have had some casualties through the men keeping too close together but after washing out of a teacup for a week or more it is worth a bit of risk to get rid of some of the trench dust and smell and feel and look clean again And really is the best bathing Ive ever had The water is quite warm and clear All the hospital work is done on board a ship that stands in the bay If the cases are serious or lengthy they are transferred to one of the hospital ships that calls daily and then go to either one of the bases or back to England We land troops night or day in spite of the fact that they come under fire so it is possible for a man to be on his way back wounded by the same ship that bought him from the base without ever having landed We had a grand voyage out All the officers had either staterooms or 1st Class cabins and the food mostly was just the same as we should have had on an ordinary cruise to India or Australia wherever it is that the Cruise Line calls The usual cabin stewards and waiters were in attendance and it was difficult to remember that we were not exactly on a pleasure trip We did enjoy those two weeks Kind regards Yours sincerely HW Cronin Lieutenant I am acting as captain until some of the others come back from hospital Dear Nic BoyceThanks very much for your interesting letter I wondered when I would hear from someone at the office Also many thanks for your good wishes and congratulations on my marriage which I have conveyed to my wife I am sure she will thank you all very muchWell to tell you a little about our experiences we started off mysteriously one Sunday from Devonport on the captured German liner Derflinger not a bad boat The Warrant Officers had 2nd class quarters it was all right Food was very fair Submarine pickets every night for one of the four companies lights out at seven or half past Stole by Gibraltar at night in a fog expecting it to be torpedoed We did reach Malta in due course after skirting north African coast spent a day there went ashore had a few drinks which we needed being very hot and then on to Alexandria for three days ashore every night not a bad place of course the lower men didnt go except for a route march on the Saturday Our movements were kept very secret and we couldnt find out what was to be done with our division we then pushed to Port Said and had a day there All of a sudden we received orders to sail and soon found we were off to Gallipoli as we were passing through the Aegean sea which is as you know full of pretty islands Some hours before reaching Lemnos the naval guns could be heard booming and we ran into the magnificent harbour there full of shipping and life After a day there we pushed on to Imbros 4½ miles from Sulva Bay during the afternoon they treated us to a naval shelling of Achi Baba which is really the other side of the peninsula but they shoot over the hills and mountains here It was a fine sight and many of our chaps went sick at once At night Sunday 9815 our good ship made for Anafarta Bay where a new landing had been effected two days before 900 rounds four days rations each as much as a man is expected to carry and they dumped us over the side in lighters a type of flatbottomed barge at 7am a short journey through the boom defences and we were ashore waiting for something to turn up Bivouacked on the beach and were put on unloading lighters till about 10 when the Turks spotted us and started shelling two men killed and four wounded to start with and we lost a few more wounded during the day although naturally we took what cover we could I had one or two near me whilst getting a timber out of the hold of a lighter but managed to dodge them all right At night my company received orders to take picks and shovels up into the firing line which was about five miles away half way up Chocolate Hill Well Nic the 10th were soon in the thick of it as we advanced across the salt lake in extended order Rifle fire now we had to dodge and many of our chaps got hit rather seriously I have since found out I was glad of a rest at the foot of the hill but had to push on again and deliver the goods after feeling about in the dark for some time our guide led us in single file up behind the firing line where we laid down bullets were whistling round but we managed to escape them The enemy were yelling for all they were worth and I was glad when our captain ordered us down again to the beach This took us some hours and when we reached the place the other three had gone up to reinforce the firing line so up we went again the next day about 6pm nearly all things are done here in the dark as we are in view all the time We again advanced across the take from Lala Baba my heels were nearly raw through new boots and I eventually had to rest for a fortnight later on Well on our right was a hill burning furiously with many a chap caught in the flames and so perishing not our regiment We finished on rather a feathered bed and did not find the other Company til next day it was a night we were all parched with the heat and no water Dried up and had to dig ourselves in its no light job this hiding being like an ostrich til you make a hole large enough to get into and make yourself head cover Dear LackMany thanks for the photographs received We all think they are good and on Saturday the six of us had out photo taken here in a similar position in khaki The two pictures together should make a lasting mementoWe have had little spare time since we have been training here Having been through company drill mixed with route marches physical drill semaphore knot tying and frog long jumping etc Some of our men were able to go to town on Saturday but I myself with a few others have been under orders for overseas service now waiting to proceed so popping up town seems out of the question for us We are numbered in alphabetical order and in the order we are sent out We are now fully equipped I enclose  postage for the photographs If you are printing any more you might save me one as I am afraid I have spoilt mine it got bent in my overcoat pocket on Saturday Please remember me to all at the office Boyce Dear BertJust a few lines to let you know I am alright hoping you are the same At the present time we are in dugouts The weather is simply awful raining day after day and especially night after nightTo tell you the truth while writing this letter I am wet through to the skin and not a dry thing for a change We have got our winter fur coats and gum boots but the latter cause more curses than you can imagine for instance last night I was sent off to select dugouts for our platoon which is number 37 It was pitch dark no light allowed and in a strange place well honestly I fell over at least 20 times got smothered in mud from head to feet and on the top of that wet though for it rained in torrents On a round of inspection this morning to see if all were comfortable I was blinded up hill and down dale Sergeant this and Sergeant thatHow can you expect men to live in this and then to put a dampener on the lot was the language from the occupiers who unfortunately were in a residence that fell in during the night They took shelter under a tree from 2am after looking for me for half an hour or so but they could not find me for the only thing that would shift me after settling down if I may call it that would be a Jack Johnson and then I would have no optionWhile in the trenches last week John and I were up to our knees in water and got our gum boots half full The line is a bit quiet lately and only now and again do we get a shelling but one gets used to it That to give you an idea is like sitting at Paddington and hearing the engines screechAfter our stretch this time I shall be looking forward for a short leave for I have been here nearly three months now and we stand a good chance Well I must now concludeYours sincerely Jack SymonsPS Every other home down near the rest camp is an Estaminet small French café where they sell what they call beer and as much as I like a drop of good beer I have given the stuff out here best for is awful muc Dear Mr HuntPlease accept yourself and convey to the other gentlemen my best thanks for the State Express cigarettes They are fine Oh what a picnic it is in the trenches just now We have been in the trenches 10 days up to now and except for the last two days it has been raining almost steadily The result is mud mud and yet more mud knee deep in places But luckily we have long top boots from trench wear so that the mud does not worry as much except that is making our feet as cold as ice We have been issued with fur jackets so we can keep our bodies warmJust now the whole countryside is covered with snow and moving objects are distinguishable a long distance off For instance this morning when I was on duty with the gun I could see the Germans walking down a road away behind their lines I had several bursts at them with the gun but they were out of range Made me damned mad I can tell you seeing the blighters and then not being able to lay them outYou cant realise the power one seems to possess when handling a Maxim Personally I feel as if I could lay out the whole German army We fire about a couple of thousand rounds every night into Fritzs trenches just to keep them quiet They the Germans have been trying to find the gun both with their Maxims and with shells but up to now theyve not succeed Kind regards to everybody Yours very sincerelyGilbert Williams I might say we are all merry and bright and not down hearted yet Dear Mr Hunt Received card alright for which I must thank you very much We are still at Longmoor and no signs of moving as I have been made cooks mate and had to work very hard all through Xmas Sapper Hodges As long as you kept your head down you were comparatively safe so as it went on this was where I had my first escape I was on sentry duty for a couple of hours from 1am to 3am and was instructed to keep a sharp look out I did not care for the idea of keeping my head above the trench and looking for beastly Germans however it had to be done it was quite uncanny to watch the enemy trench which appeared somewhat like a black wave and only sixty yards in front then you would suddenly see the flash of their rifles and machine guns immediately after would come the report and nasty thuds on the sandbags which you might be resting against I fired about five shots at their flashes the only target to aim at then another two shells which lodged in the parapet either side of my head leaving about 2 to 3 inches between me and certain death I thought that near enough but it turned out that it was to have something nearer than that Our casualties here amounted on the average to about two per day killed of course we thought it terrible at the time at least I did Early April saw us relieved by another division and we were sent a few miles back for a wellearned rest which consisted of physical drill and a run before breakfast The remainder of the morning being spent in platoon drill musketry drills After dinner we put the cap on our rest why so called I do not know by having a route march for two hours We spent a few days like this and were dispatched with all possible speed to Ypres here we went in to support the Canadians and spent a most unpleasant eight days during which time we lost several hundred men nearly all my friends who came out in the same draft and were killed or wounded we had to retire the best part being that the Germans did not find this out until two days after when we were more or less safely bivouacking in a very pretty wood We stayed here for about a week then we got to work again digging reserve trenches just behind the front line building up parapets which had been demolished by the enemys high explosive shells and such like working all night and getting what sleep we could in the daytime One morning we were awakened by the most awful din it seemed as though hell had broken loose shells were falling like summer rain And people have often told me in the course of conversation it was raining shells and I admit I took it with a grain of salt could not be possible I thought but such I was surprised to find was possible and actually taking place there about 330am This bombardment started and about half an hour later I with three others were ordered to start reinforcing We went up in fours it being considered safer that way half a mile over open ground we had to do this being swept continually with shells to give you a slight idea I can say the previous night just in front of our reserve trenches was a beautifully green field and the next morning it was as much as one could do to see any grass at all simply one mass of craters varying in diameter from ten to twelve paces I had gone about half the required distance when a shell fell only a yard from where I was the force of the concussion explosion pitched me several yards to my left and I came down rather heavily however I reached the first line without any further mishap where we had to stay until midnight when we had to be relieved again owing to not having enough me to hold the trench Our honours were one VC Victoria Cross two DSO  Distinguished Service Orders one Military Cross and one or two DCM Distinguished Conduct MedalsThe next day I paraded sick my back paining me so much that I could not stand straight for a week after I am now back with the regiment who are on the line of communications We are having leave shortly and if possible will pay a visit to the Audit office Have you any news of Chichester Yours trulyRifleman EHC Stewart This trench of ours is a model in its own way being fairly safe and connected by good communication trenches The Commanding Officers house of white sandbags is fitted with window curtains and window box with pansies in it It is furnished with table and chairs also a large mirror Of course this is quite a one occasion affair and dont imagine we are here town planning with model dwellings etc But it will show you how soldiers can adapt themselves to circumstances At the back of our trench is ripening corn and plenty of wildflowers in bloomWe have also canaries in cages in the trench But these are used by the miners for testing the air in the mines after the explosion to see if it was possible to finish off their job Censored line captured from the Germans a short time ago and during the stay we were kept busy with sandbags etc and at night of course had to especially watch the enemy When in the reserve or support trenches fatigue work has to be done every night such as carrying food ammunition material for the engineers etc to the firing line so you can guess it is nothing but continual bob work odd jobs Dear Mr Hunt Many thanks for your welcome letter volunteering so much interesting news of friends at the office I wrote to Standew just before receiving your letter but no doubt a few more lines will be acceptable Beaumont seems to be doing the best of us all I saw Williams and Hull about three weeks ago in a small town near here Of course the Seaforths and Argylls regiments always move about together but we dont meet very often I am glad to hear the old section is still in being and not like the German Empire is fast becoming a thing of the past And hope your three survivors will be allowed to keep the flag flying until the wanderers return I have been in the firing line several times and at four different places besides being in the support trenches at others I hear this is called a mobile division which accounts for our gipsy life in France Our last turn in the firing line for six days and six in the reserve was the most exciting of all It has been a quiet place for two months until two days after our occupation when the British exploded mines under some workings of the Germans near their trenches to prevent them blowing our trench up Well That woke them up and the following Saturday they retaliated by opening rapid fire early in the morning However we were ready for them and quickly replied so they then bombarded us which to say the least of it was a noisy business That eventually ceased and rapid firing was quickly in process again followed by another shelling which our guns again put a stop to The whole affair lasted an hour and ten minutes and although we believe an attack was intended the Germans didnt leave their trench opposite to us After putting our trench in order again which took some time as the parapet was blown down for about three yards near me and a shell burst amongst a lot of beef tins scattering them and the contents in all directions besides the bottom of the trench being littered with hundreds of empty cartridges we proceeded with boiling water for tea also to show the Huns by the smoke that we were still there Only a hundred yards separated the two trenches so it was always a case of bob down and the enemy were good shots as we found out to our cost when they smashed the top glasses in two periscopes within half an hour one morning At present the division is resting and I and two friends have erected a wee bivouac under an apple tree on a farm It is quite cosy in fine weather but last night it was raining hard for several hours so we had to beat a hasty retreat to an old barn There is plenty of fruit about here but the water supply is very bad Last Sunday morning we enjoyed our first hot bath since our arrival here An old disused brewery has been turned into baths for troops also under clothing is washed and disinfected and kilts ironed there Fifty tubs are provided for washing in and two large vats filled with cold water to plunge into afterwards I have not got any stripes yet but have been studying signalling lately so expect soon to be in the signal section I must close now to get this letter away hoping Mr Taylor Mr Woodhams and yourself are keeping well and with kind regards to you all Yours very sincerely Frosty Dear Gerald Many thanks for letter which was somewhat a surprise to me No the news was quite fresh as I do not hear from anybody in the office We have just come from the trenches where we were for seven days and had a most awful time We were three days in the Reserve and put in the firing line where we took part in an attack and were also under a very heavy bombardment I am sorry to say we had many casualties thirty five killed and one hundred and thirty eight wounded and I can assure you it was an experience I shall never forget Anyhow Williams Kemball and myself came out quite safely I have seen Frost out here of course his battalion 8th Argyll  Sutherland Highlanders are in the same brigade also as a matter of fact they were in the firing line the night we came out I received a letter while I was in the trenches from Mr Slater Yes I heard about Chamberlain jolly sad was it not if you do hear from Dick James you might pass any news on to meShall be glad to hear from you I could write more only am a wee bit tired after seven days in trenches I am yours sincerely Fred HullPS Of course you know my address Remember me to all I know Dear BurgieWas very glad indeed to get your letters although your news in regard to Joe comes as a shock It was the first I had heard of him since he arrived in France in spite of the fact his regiment being quite close Am afraid the 9th and few days following were rotten days for a good many battalions our lot as much as any We have been in since the 8th and have had a fairly trying time we were reinforced during this week not before time as we were down to our last two hundred Cant tell how sorry I am to hear about Joe as you say he was one of the best I hope you chaps have not been annoyed at my not answering your very welcome letters I dont pride myself much on writing good yarns though and opportunities are also hard to find As you know I had a bit of a knock at Neuve Chappell but have quite got over that and am now in the best of health and spirits I came across Len Phillips and Peter Hawes in different drafts of the London Scottish while down at Rouen both of them have now had some experience on the job I expect Thank Mr Drewe very much for making inquiries tell him I occasionally wish heartily to be on the old job again the quiet life will do for me after this No I did not get Dicks magazine or letter expect it went astray while I was in hospital Thank him very much for sending them will you Had a game of football about two weeks ago with RGA Battery the pitch being a serious drawback I think it was a cabbage patch Still we managed to get a good game in and most important of all won The weather here has on the whole been very good just lately only getting an occasional days rain Last night we had a sharp thunderstorm a new experience it had at least the effect of shutting all the other disturbances of our rest up so we did not grouse Much obliged for all the information re the other fellows Am glad most of them are getting on so well Peacock seems to have come out top dog The job alone from other examples seems to be a paying one leaving out the holiday in Scotland Well must close my epistle Please remember me to Dick Mr Horsley Ransley and Drewe Fox Hoping both they and yourself are like myself OK Line censored From yours faithfully Dear Effie Very pleased to receive your letter like yourself I find my correspondence voluminous for me at times especially since I have taken on the duties of Platoon Sergeant which takes up more time than one realises at first We are still in the trenches and have been in action twenty four days consecutively and I dont know long we shall keep it up Had a dirty time yesterday morning dodging damned great bombs the blighters were presenting to us without exaggeration they were eighteen inches to a two feet long and made a hole about ten feet deep and fifteen feet diameter at least we did not wait to see them burst They can be seen descending through the air and then a scoot is made to get as far as possible round the corner the iron and dirt seem to be falling for a minute afterwards they are disturbing Dicky Gilson has not been with us the last twenty four days he broke his glasses and would not buy new ones went to the doctor and all that and worked the oracle and was left behind with the Transport dont know whether he worked the ticket properly and got a safer job farther back should not blame him if he has his nerves have been in a shocking state hed brood a lot as you know that is absolutely fatal when you have a dirty job on like this I have not seen either Frost or Kemball out here do not seem to meet anybody fresh as we are always in the same district and relieve the same crowds generally Our pals the French in my opinion scrap jolly well except in the isolated instances which are given undue prominence by our chaps by prejudice probably The casualties have certainly been enormous but a lot of them are a week old and one cannot form any opinion of what is going on by the lists and I should not be allowed to say what I thought of our doings lately Cronin is still with the 5th Bedfordshires and not out yet I think not likely to be in all probability Only wish we could repeat our swimming performance off Penarth specially the Wednesday evening ones Have heard rumours of leave being given shortly but do not rely much on it have been offered a Commission in this Battalion and I may take it up if my papers go through satisfactorily Kindest regards and wishes to Mrs Lewis Your old Pal Dear Mr Hunt Many thanks for your long and interesting letter which I was very pleased to receive I am sorry I have been unable to answer it before but I have been constantly moving about from one place to another lately and have had no opportunity of writing letters Well I am very pleased to say I am feeling very fit and well and quite enjoying the life When writing to you last I was attached to the 4th Division and was stationed at a small village where we were living in tents We were stationed there about six weeks Just over a week ago I was transferred to another place about eighty miles from the other one I travelled by motor lorry with the Supply column and it took us all day from 730am till about 9 oclock in the evening to do the journey It was a glorious trip the scenery being very fine Almost as good as our office outing only not quite such comfortable travelling We put up for the night in a small village sleeping in the lorry with some empty petrol cans for a bed Next morning I was taken to the railhead where I was stationed until yesterday being only in that place just a week While there we were all still sleeping in tents but I was fortunate enough to have my meals with the Post Office Staff so have had a rest from being my own cook Yesterday afternoon just as I was going for my tea I was sent for and told to pack up my things and catch a train to another railhead as I had to take charge as the AMFO for three Divisions there As there is usually a man attached to each division this was rather a large order I only had about twenty miles or so to go but it took from 5 oclock till after 9pm to get there These French trains are very rapid I am now attached to the 51st Highland Division the same division as Williams a number of his lot were here today but he was not with them We shall probably only be here for a few days and will then move to another village further on I was very surprised to hear of Mr Pritchards death I also heard that Mr Crossley is also dead We are having glorious weather here at present and very hot at times Glad to hear you are having a soft time on the old section I was very pleased to hear about the collection of letters and photos from the troops that you are sending round the office and will certainly send you a photo later on I have has some taken but have not received them yet Have you heard from Ferdie or Gray at all We all had our photos taken at Longmoor before we came out here a group of six Unfortunately I only had a few copies and they have all been sent away Ferdie and Gray are still at the Base I believe but Arthur Smith is at one of the railheads somewhere Well I dont think I can tell you any more news at present Will write again later and send photo Kindest regards to all Yours sincerely Dear Bertie Just a few lines to let you know how I am getting on Am having the time of my life out here No doubt you have seen the several letters I have written to the office during the past few months so will not go into further details except to say that I have been exceedingly fortunate in seeing so much of India in a short time I shall never forget my trip through the Khyber Pass which has since been the scene of hard fighting one consequence of which we were hurriedly moved from Fyzabad to Rawalpindi in readiness to reinforce You would scarcely credit the feeling of disappointment that exists among the few British regular regiments left in India over not being ordered to France to take their share in the war The same feeling also exists in the Territorials A dragoon then left a few weeks ago to replace heavy casualties among the Norfolk regiment at the Gulf As the hot weather commenced the latter part of April and as many British troops as possible are always sent to the hills being almost unbearable on the plains we are fortunate enough to go and had a three days march and climb to this place 8000 feet up Well I never in any wild stretch of imagination ever dreamed that I should be soldiering in the Himalayan mountains Kuldana although 8000 feet up is on the lower Himalaya and from my bungalow which is situated on the edge of a steep precipice I can see lovely views which words fail to describe a perfect mixture of Devonshire Scotch and Alpine scenery Although seemingly only a few miles off the higher snow clad ranges in full view are from 100 to 150 miles away I have about 1½ miles trek to our Sergeants mess through beautiful scenery lovely wild rose bushes climbing up giant pink trees smothering them in roses maiden hair fern and all kinds of pretty flowers in the woods The climate is perfect lovely English summer weather with delightful mountain breezes The heat in India has not distressed me in the least not even on long arduous marches I am feeling splendidly fit and well and trust I shall continue so We have no end of gaiety all the married families of the Yorkshire regiment are living in our barracks under our charge as their regiments had to remain behind at Pindi and are being bitten to death almost with mosquitoes So we have Cinderella dances about three times a week whist drives racquet and tennis parties and have most enjoyable times I wish May and Eileen could take an aeroplane trip of a few hours and get to me it would be ripping for them I should be glad to hear that you had called to see them on your promised visit of months ago when I was home they would be awfully glad to see you both Do drop them a card old boy Fancy it is 10 months ago today since I left to go to camp what a lot has transpired since then I was in the 8th Middlesex 12 months ago and I see they have lost heavily in France funny I should have left them and joined the 6th East Surrey and to pass them at Gibraltar where they were first on my way to India On the whole I am enjoying life in India immensely I am acting Company Sergeant Major now and expect to be promoted to the rank shortly We are all Tommies now Trusting you are both fit and well Remember me to Stacey Yours sincerely Dear Mr Wheeler Just a few lines to let you know of my whereabouts This is our fifth Sunday at sea We left Southampton on Thursday October 29th shortly before midnight and our convoy of ten huge liners each with about 1700 to 2000 territorial troops on board assembled in the English Channel early next morning We were escorted by British warships as far as our first port of call Malta the French warships to Port Said After staying one night there we proceeded through the Suez Canal We lay off the Port of Suez six days waiting for another escort then on through the Red Sea to Aden where we stayed four days waiting for our Japanese escort When it arrived it brought with it an immense convoy of over 80 huge liners transports filled with New Zealand and Indian troops This in addition to a convoy of thirty five vessels that came into Suez whilst we lay there So it may truly be sung that Britannia rules the waves It has been a most delightful and interesting voyage and the weather is now so hot that hundreds of troops are compelled to sleep on deck nightly as the heat is much too great below We landed two cases of fever at Aden Fortunately it does not appear to have spread any further so far We expect to reach Bombay on Wednesday next December 2nd then three or four days train journey to Fyzabad some distance north of Lucknow Shall be very glad to get there as five weeks on board a crowded troop ship with very little opportunity for exercise is getting rather irksome especially when we get no Daily Paper only a little wireless war news occasionally I am glad to say that I am wonderfully fit and well Our food has been wholesome and plentiful Trusting you are well with my best wishes for as Happy a Christmas as is possible under prevailing war conditions and a Prosperous New Year in due course Also please convey same to Messrs Wood Welsh Davis and others Hoping to see you again on the termination of our successful conclusion of the war Believe me yours faithfully H Beaumont Will you also convey my respects to Mr Price please Dear Arthur I expect you are wondering why I have not written but it is an awful effort to get all correspondence off and be on active service at the same time I cant say that I am enjoying myself out here Its awfully hot and we are eaten up by millions of flies Life in the trenches is not a picnic either we have about four or five days out of them and eight or nine in them When we are out supposed to be resting we have to go on working parties digging etc then wherever we are we are always under shell fire so its not much rest after all The last shell we had in camp there was four killed and seventeen wounded We have been under fire for three months now and we should like a rest as the strain is tremendous on ones nerves I dont think the troops in France get it quite as bad Then again the only comforts we have are sent from home as the country here is quite barren and we cannot buy anything in shops I would give a quid for a pint of beer down the club Our food consists of half a loaf of bread per day bacon and tea for breakfast Bully beef and biscuits for dinner and Jam for tea and cheese Lime juice is served out about four times per week that is a drop is put into a dixie of water and a cup full served out per man and rum is served out twice a week sometimes that is about four table spoonful each We live in a trench and it is a mercy it dont rain otherwise wed be washed away The fighting just lately has been terrible Our shells knock the enemy all ways and the sight in the trenches that we take is awful We wear our respirators because of the awful smell of the dead Ill never get the sight out of my eyes and it will be an everlasting nightmare If I am spared to come home Ill be able to tell you all about it but I cannot possibly write as words fail me I cant describe things Wouldnt it be nice to be at Walmer again and you come down and see me again I did enjoy that time and also seeing Billy Dawson and Richardson There seem to be a lot of French troops out here but there seems to be no relief for us Nobody loves us now Churchill has gone we are nobodys pets Its the army first here except when there is work to be done and then the Naval Division have to do it You know both my brothers have commissions in the 4th Bedfordshires and are at Dovercourt My wife tells me she has sent me three boxes of stuff I received one box and I fear that one transport has been floundered sunk and another has been torpedoed so I expect that is where my other two boxes are Its awfully disappointing because I do look forward so to a bit of chocolate and a few biscuits from home We get cigarettes and baccy served out to us but it is too hot to smoke much so that I dont miss that so much I get a bath in a biscuit tin when I can but when in the trenches I have to go all the time without a wash so you can tell I am used to being dirty How are they all down the club and is Emmie still there and is she better or not Is Paice going to Looe this year And where are you spending your holidays Lord how Id like a holiday I am so tired and would give anything to get away from this continual banging Please remember me to all fellows who are left in the office Mr Miller and Goff  Hills and George Williams and all the boys generally I cant write to all separately also for details of my experiences you must wait until I get back if ever I do of which sometimes I despair The papers tell you pretty full accounts although they are rather anticipating events as to our advancing Now I must close old chap and thank you very much for all your kindness Wishing you all the best Dear BertieMany thanks for letters and fags both were very acceptable as you can imagine for it bucks one up to hear from old associates I also had a letter from Tinker Taylor who told me Gwen has left the Great Western Railway Company I will write to Ferdi Ferdinand and ask Frosty if you give me his address I can imagine how lovely and empty the old room looks fancy more flappers eh quite a selection as you say I will just give you an idea of our work here day by day Reveille 600am stables at 630730 breakfast till 9 Then exercise ride one and lead two or three horses for one and a half hours then groom them until 1215 then we water and feed and go to dinner till 230 then sweep up  down at 4pm then water and feed at 415 to 430 and hay up at 5pm only we take it in turns to do that and we have stables like this Fatty has drawn a rough sketch of the stables which house the horses We have six and seven a side which leaves us four horses each Of course sandwiched between this is probably a visit to Avonmouth Docks to fetch horses or take ours to the station for we only keep them for a week at the time just to knock the mud off and feed them up so as they get their shore legs and look a bit shipshape again We have about 10000 a week come in of horses and mules and some of them are fair devils so wild and timidI may come and see you probably Saturday if I get the weekend off  Dear ErnieThanks very much for your letter and kind wishes My wounds are getting on all right and they have discovered eleven in all It is hard not to be able to get up but I suppose a month will soon be slip by My people came to see me yesterday and the day beforeYou ought to see my face They cannot shave me because I have scraps of shell sticking in and as I had not had a shave for about a week before I was wounded I look a pretty pictureWell old chap I am glad I am wounded to get out of that hell and if you ever meet a chap that says he wants to go back call him a liarIf you could manage to come down at any time I should be delighted I have not received any letter from Dalton but perhaps will get it later That will be the time old chap when I look into the office on my way home Well manage to get a drink then  Well I must close now and I expect you will have quite enough trouble to read what I have written already Hoping to be with you allYour old pal Rip Dear SirI have now been out in France a fortnight I am getting on quite well in the army Food is also good and plentiful Of course I find the life much rougher from that which I have been used to but it is a fine experience all the sameWe were at Longmoor camp for a week where we were equipped and put through elementary drills We slept in a big hut there and had a sack of straw and three blankets each The huts of which ours was one were called Apple Pie and they are about a mile from the camp so we had to be up about six every morning in order to march down for parade at the camp The parade was at 715am Some mornings we had an hours drill before breakfast It was about 11pm I should think when we arrived at Longmoor on 31st March and consequently we went straight to our hut No light was provided so we had to fish about for our beds in the dark Fortunately it was moonlight and after some time a lantern was brought We were only too glad when getting up time came the next morning It was before six We were marched down to the camp and were inspected by the Sergeant Major and after waiting some time went into breakfast Roast sausage was the chief item on the menu but to our amazement no knives and forks were supplied for usWell the only thing was to convey the sausages to our mouths with fingersThe nearest thing to a knife and fork that some had was a pair of nail scissors so these were used Personally I did not know whether to feel shocked or to laugh at the situation it ended in the latter We Audit fellows got to one table and we had to have a good laugh before we could eat much It was a hopeless situation to be in Dont let this discourage anyone from coming but I warn him to bring a knife and fork with him After the first day we were issued with kits and we treasure our knives and forks now We came across on the mail boat Hantonia from Southampton to Havre  We had to sleep in huts there on the docks but the sleeping accommodation was better We Audit fellows were able to keep together till last Saturday night when Pond and I were sent off to different railheads He is at 3rd Corps Railhead We had to travel in horseboxes and during night time We travelled in this manner Saturday Sunday and Monday nights French shunting is severe and we were shaken up Saturday and Sunday we were about 30 in the trucks Monday 17 We were fortunate enough to get out into every town at which we stopped during the day On Tuesday night another young fellow and I were stranded at a station somewhere in France and we were instructed by the military authorities to sleep in the goods shed We had to sleep on the deck of the shed and shunting was going on during the night This was about the limit I thought I arrived finally at my destination about midday last Wednesday Now I live in a truck at a small French station There are two other Sappers and a Lieutenant here We deal chiefly with gifts and comforts sent to the troopsWe are out in the country I think this railhead is about seven miles from the firing line Can hear the guns and see the star shells at night I must ask you kindly to excuse me for writing in pencil because I have no pen and ink here Would you mind letting this letter be treated as to the whole of the statistical department please sir With kindest regards to all I am yours obediently My dear MotherI Have just come through a particularly nasty period We went into the trenches on Wednesday night and on Sunday morning at 5am our Artillery commenced bombarding the German trenches and after 20 minutes had elapsed we went over the parapet My goodness what a reception the Huns had in store for us they simply swept the ground with machine gun fire and shrapnel Poor old C coy caught it hot and Neuve Chapelle seemed to be a fleabite compared with this It was found impossible to make any advance in our quarter so I dug myself in and awaited events It was horrible suspense as I seemed to be the only man untouched all around me and being personally acquainted with each man made matters worse in fact its all wrong to call them men as they were mostly mere boys About early afternoon I was hailed from the trench as to whether it was possible for me to get back I replied in the affirmative and decided to run the risk of getting potted on the way So I commenced crawling on my stomach until about a few yards from the parapet then made a spring and rushed headlong over the top nearly spoiling the features of a few who happened to be in the trench and were not expecting me We were relieved that afternoon but some of the fellows did not get in until nightfall and these experienced another bombardment Billy Hastings is quite fit and the only pal left We have been resting since and getting information about the illegible but by all reports we shall be up again soon No rest for the wicked it is said and if true we must surely be a bad lot What a terrible thing about the Lusitania and with so many Americans aboard Should imagine there will be more trouble Have received box and letter dated 6th and am most thankful for everything you are all doing for me censored As regards the pads masks of cotton pads which served as gas masks all we were served out with were made on the spot and consisted of a piece of gauze and tape and were steeped in a solution of bicarbonate of soda prior to this charge I lost all my belongings except the Gillette razor so should be glad of a few toilet requisites when next you are sending a parcel Do not trouble about towel and perhaps Frank would get me a shaving brush Must now close Much love to all From your affectionate son I am much nearer the front now and we moved here last Tuesday It was a long march and of course done at night and our present billet is a farm or the remains of one in a large village about ¾ mile from the trenches more north than we were before and nearer the Belgian frontier It is an awfully desolate spot and constantly under shell fire This morning I was trying to get a sleep on the grass when a shell burst in a tree not fifty yards away and sent a shower of leaves to the ground Fortunately no one was hit another burst in the same field ten minutes afterwards then I thought it was time to shift So went into a barn There are a number of dugouts around but they are so cold and you might get buried inside The farm is a vile place with a lot of stagnant water around and a lot of German soldiers are buried here The barn where we sleep would be improved if a shell struck the roof and ventilated it in our absence As the smell inside is bad and makes it nearly necessary to wear a respirator The rats seem to object to our company as they often have a free fight on top of usLast night was my first experience in the trenches and we returned to billet this morning The din is simply awful and just lately the big guns have been giving the enemy beans every night I am glad to say we had no casualties although the rifle fire was heard at times especially on our left where the Germans made an attack on the Indian troops The British gun fire was simply terrific all night and the Germans did not reply very much It was fine to watch the flashes of our guns at our backs although the screaming of the shells overhead is at first rather scaring to say the least of it However the news we hear from day to day at this part of the front is very cheerful and encouraging Yesterday I came across an Indian soldier who could speak English very well and he thought another month would see the war over also a German officer captured near here said it could not go on very much longer I for one hope these remarks will prove correctThe church here is practically demolished just some of the walls and tower standing and the churchyard is in a bad state Great holes have been made and bones exposed In these holes is water sufficiently deep to drown anybody Great stone vaults have been opened and coffins and bodies can be seen Of course the place here is not inhabited except by soldiers I have been through some of the big houses and plenty of good carved furniture pictures fittings etc still remain in them I also have been in some of the gardens and roses just coming into bloom can be seen in great numbers I should like to see them at home Well I must close now and hope you are all keeping well Again thanking you all for our good wishes Sincerely yours S Frost Dear Nic First of all I must thank you and the others who sent me their kind letters of sympathy in regard to my brother Sam We all felt it very much at home and it was a great shock to our parents naturally but it cant be helped as he was killed in a good cause I suppose you have heard how we left Bedford early on Sunday 18715 and had a lovely trip down the old firm to Keyham we were well laden and I was glad to get aboard and get to my berth in which I am very comfortable with two other Warrant Officers The men and Sergeants are on the troop deck and none too comfortable but are jogging along alright now The first part of the voyage the sea was very quiet we passed Gibraltar in a fog at night so couldnt see it We then skirted the coast of Algeria and had a pleasant run to Malta where we stopped a full day The higher officials went ashore for a few hours including myself and had a good time I cannot mention troops or ships so refrain from doing so but there was a hell of a lot Our next stop was Alexandria for three days where we had another look round including a route march for the Battalion The sea is fairly rough at this end rather surprising but a lovely colour light blue at day and dark at night All lights out at 800 perfect darkness there is no twilight to speak of being dark at 730pm We then wondered where we were off to but eventually reached Port Said stopped a day went ashore and off we go to the Dardanelles which we expect to reach tonight Our kits have been left behind in Egypt and all we have got we stand in We are now passing through the Aegean sea full of rocky islands very much like the highlands of Scotland Bullen has just lost his helmet over the side but is otherwise wellI am in the best of health at present and hope to go through alright I expect you heard I got married a week before I left a lot of us did the same thing it was quite a common occurrence Our old boat is a captured German liner and is full up but we have got a Greek crew with a few Portuguese thrown in and so are a mixed lot especially with Welsh men aboard How are things going at the office I have been away nearly a year I shall be glad to hear from you now and again just to keep in touch I must close now as they say a mail is being collected before we land Yours sincerely Dear Burgie Thanks awfully for your letter glad to hear that you are all serene and that the GWR is still flourishing without me as a matter of fact I expect its better without me but still there you are By Jove I had no idea that the Audit had shoved so many fellows into khaki its fine Well the old Brigade has had some pretty varied experiences in this land of stinks and bad beer We landed at Havre last March and after a freezing night under canvas on the heights behind the town we had a rather weird train journey up country There were about 10 of us per cattle truck with a few wisps of straw to sleep on Our horses were boxed six in a truck three with their heads facing the engine and three facing the rear of the train Two men sat on corn sacks between their bottoms If they kept the shutters closed they had a beautiful journey as it was so warm with the horsesAt about 2am the old caboodle pulled up and we thought we were in for a dreary hang about however the order came down to bring out the dixies and fall in for something hot I took our one up and the liquid smelt so good that with a little judicious wangling we managed to get another one full When we tasted it it was simply gorgeous Boiling hot coffee and rum as only Frenchmen can make it you know how Gee but it did go down a treat Well after many jolts and bumps we arrived at our destination It was miles from the firing line and a fearful hole at that At nine next morning we were off again and went up further still riding about 23 miles before we came to anchor at a rather dirty mining villageAfter about three weeks in this show we shunted up and got our baptism Its a funny sensation being under fire for the first time but it soon wears off One gets a rather nasty jolt when the first casualty occurs especially as it was in our case the finest fellow we had on the staff He got a chunk of shell in the back of his neck and was killed on the spot We were in action at this place for about two months and took part in several bombardments one of them being the one in which poor old Joey was killed We had some pretty rough times but were very fortunate as regards casualties Two months action and 2½ days rest it doesnt seem much but thats what we got and then at it again in a different part This show had been occupied by the Germs and then by the French from whom we took over The filth and stench was too awful for words one of our batteries striking rather unlucky in coming across Germs buried just under the surface when they started digging their guns in The air was blue for milesThe next action we had was a hell of a show The staff were put into a huge Chateau which was under observation and fire from three sides And they didnt half sling the lead about too Its marvellous that we didnt get lifted skywards heaps of times but still here we are After a good spell in this show we came to rest again about 10 days or so ago We are having a good time here in the way of concerts sports boxing tournaments etc The latter was great especially the bout between a Farrier Sergeant and a cooks mate They biffed at one another until neither could stand it was awfully funny Little Seedy Ellis has got a snip job at a base He came up today with a draught of men He is having the time of his life and looks it by the dark circles under his eyesI am feeling wonderfully fit and well and would not have missed coming out for quids I suppose you saw in the paper that two of our boys have got the Distinguished Conduct Medal They were in Major Lord Gorells Battery he is awfully bucked about it Well old man I must dry up I hope you can read this disgusting scrawl but will make that whiskered excuse active service conditions Please remember me to all the boys and tell Long Liz that I would give anything for a barrel or two of the club bitter  Dear Mr Rogers Just a few lines to let you know I am still alive and have up to now succeeded in dodging those small pieces of lead which have been so frequently flying about the Peninsular Dardanelles I expect you are wondering how I got here also why Con convalescent Camp I will try and tell you briefly what happened since our leaving Egypt We left Alexandria 13th August and landed at the new landing at Sulva Bay on the 18th under shell fire Not a very nice kick off Our first engagement was on the 21st when we took part in the big fight for Hill 70 and 971 I expect you read about it in the papers for I see the Daily Sketch had a page full of it They spoke of us as the Irresistable Yeomanry very glowing words of our charge also It was a very stiff go and we were fighting from 3pm the 21st until dark on the 22nd and never stopped advancing and retiring the whole time We had the Hill on the night of the 21st but could not hold it because no support was sent up so the Yeomanry those of us who were left had to retire at night after charging and capturing three lines of Turkish trenches Our Brigade Berkshire Buckinghamshire and Dorset Yeomanry was ordered to do the charging for the Division and I think we did fairly well from what the General said in his report Of course we suffered pretty heavy After five days on the Peninsular we did not have an Officer left in our regiment and only barely half the men I have seen a few of our Officers in the casualty list but no men I was very pleased to get the GRW Magazine while resting in dugouts on Chocolate Hill I hope no more of the Audit boys have fallen since the last I saw I suppose you are still pretty slack in the office I find Ive run away from the tale but here in the YMCA tent it is so crowded and the piano on the go it is rather difficult to write After resting from the big fight three days we went into the trenches for spells of five days on one case seven days After five weeks I caught dysentery and had to come away I was put on a hospital ship and brought to St Patricks Hospital Malta During those five weeks I was pretty lucky The only close bullet was one through my right sleeve and grazing my arm We all have some very narrow shaves from shrapnel I had the sandbags of my dugout knocked down one day but fortunately I was down to get water Probably if I had been inside I would have caught it properly I expect to be here about a fortnight to three weeks before I go back I am hoping the boys will be across before that and the Turkish army cut in two I suppose the office still looks more empty than it ever did How is Mr Jackson getting on in France I see his regiment has been in action I have often wondered how he would get on in trench warfare I suppose McConnel is still going strong Will not stop for more now as I shall lose the mail Kind regards to Mr Cox and all the men on the section Hope you are still enjoying the best of health and still dodging the bombs Hope to write again soon Yours truly Dear Effie You were doubtless surprised to get a postcard from up here dont know why they sent us such a long way north it is alright but I think London would have suited me better could have seen my pals sometimes I am not allowed to get out of bed yet tried the other night and fell down in a fit serves me right for disobeying orders I have the piece of shell which fractured my skull and shall look after it for a souvenir The doctors say I was very lucky not to have been put right out It was a heavy piece British would not have been wounded by anything less We were in an advanced post sticking beyond our front line called the Ducks Bill and naturally pretty close to the German trenches In fact they surrounded us I hear from Bedford that the company has been told to prepare for the Dardanelles I dont know where he is though have heard nothing from him We are having a concert with our ward this afternoon and we have plenty of visitors in every afternoon some very fair women taking them generally and very decent too treat everybody alike Remember me kindly to Mrs Lewis I shall make a more determined attempt to see you if I get a sick leave which is most probable Well have no more news at present How about taking up a post in your department when this lot is over it would suit me to have headquarters in London for a time mustnt count chickens though Goodbye Old boy Dear Mr Hunt Thanks for the cigarettes and magazine all very much appreciated and I want to confess something I am terribly short of cigarettes just now Dont know how to get on So you had Peter Jackson up to see you a short time ago Lord how I wish I could get up to London Some of our chaps have leave but this advance seems to have put a stop to it Thats the only reason I am sorry for the long awaited advance God knows it was really time we did do something if only to relieve the pressure on Eastern front We are in this part of the line and are still sitting tight worse luck I wish they would get a move on here as well It has cost us a good many casualties but I think the Germans what with the bombardment they got and the counter attacks they delivered must have lost many more than us I have got an interesting souvenir It is part of the framework of a German aeroplane the fourth which our airmen have recently brought down in this neighbourhood The machine gun in one of our planes had killed the German pilot and the machine getting out of control exploded or at least the engine did and the whole aircraft crashed to earth God it was an awful mess Both the pilot and observer were killed the former being bashed out recognition but the latter survived the fall but died shortly afterwards Our airmen seem to be the masters of the Germans now although the taubes seem to be the faster machines our men seem to have much spirit and initiative About a fortnight ago I saw a fleet of fourteen of our planes cross over our lines on a raiding expedition They were in close formation and the Germans sent up a rain of shells without doing any damage The raid was very successful I believe two transport trains full of German reinforcements being wrecked a large station destroyed Well thats about all from me let me hear from you soon How is everybody up there Best regards to all the section Dear Dada Many thanks for the Slough paper and magazines Was very sorry to see that Jefferies and How have lost their lives I heard from Arthur this morning and he tells me that Fred Blane has died of wounds in the Dardanelles I expect you remember him in the Windsor Operatic Society Harold White Ginger who lived with Arthur has joined the Royal Artillery Garrison and is now at Plymouth Arthur has sold the motorbike Petrol is too expensive he says Since I wrote last I have been moved to a little village about 2½ miles out of the town I was in then It is a dead and alive hole with only a few houses and two cafes only one of which is open The other has had all the windows blown out We expect to move further on still in a day or two We have changed our truck for a much larger one and have made ourselves very comfortable It is about 30 feet long so we have divided it off with our ground sheets for curtains at one end to make a bedroom and the rest of the truck we have fitted up with desks and cupboards I spent the other evening making a table out of bacon boxes etc At present we are living very well indeed with bacon and kidneys for breakfast steaks and vegetables for dinner jam and honey etc for tea and bread and cheese and pickles for supper Not bad for active service The Post Office cook still does all our cooking There are four of us on the staff here now One attached to each of the three divisions and one learning the work who will probably leave soon to take charge of a division There have been plenty of aeroplanes over here lately A German came over the other evening and our people shelled it for about half an hour I dont know whether it was brought down or not I had a nice long letter from Mr Hunt yesterday He sent me photo of the Roll of Honour and told me all the latest Audit office news Well I dont think I have much more to tell you at present so will conclude with love to all Dear Bert Many thanks for your letter received a few days ago also for the good old Woodbines which I got today While I think of it in your letter you refer to a report published in the 6th monthly Magazine for August 15 will you send me a copy as I have not seen it Well we have had about the biggest gruelling we could wish for The Huns bombarded us in the trenches for over two hours with Jack Johnson shells shrapnel whizz bangs terrible things and trench mortars blew the parapets to blazes and nearly blew the whole lot of us up The General Officer Commanding has complimented us on our behaviour We are now resting at a place called Vlamertinghe just south of Ypres and a couple miles North of Poperinghe Poperinge in Belgium We deserve a rest for we have spent thirtynine days in dugouts and the trenches except three days and needless to tell you we are very crummy which tends to spoil the rest we are having I never thought I was going to another phase of them after South Africa I was in Poperinghe where I met Jackson a few weeks agoThe beauty of it out here is we can stand a pal a drink and also have one with him I suppose shall have to wait for my increase being an absentee from the office anyway they can add it on to my salary as soon as they like for I shall then be able to pay more income tax I enclose a few postcards They are showing in each card before and after or during and after the bombardment of Ypres so you can guess what the place looks like Well Bert in conclusion I must tell you that one of our Sergeants who is on leave posted this in London for me thats why I am able to give you a few details Kind regards to all friends in the Audit Dear Mr Jones Just a line to let you know that Im still alive and am moving to Kings Lynn on Wednesday next Will write you later How do you like the photo Best regards to the office From H Giles Dear Father I do hope you and mother have not been worrying much about me as I am getting on all right My wound is well now and the broken bone is my only trouble  the two ends took the wrong turning first time so a couple of days ago they put them on the right road again I ought not to be left with a short leg as there is about 40lb weight on the end of it in fact I should not be surprised if it finishes off ahead of the other One good thing is I get very little pain except when I am moved Did you get my postcard I havent had an answer yet but expect letters take a long while I believe I asked you to send me some fruit but as things take such a long while to get here I am afraid it would be bad besides they take French money here and as I drew 5 from the Field Cashier only a few days before I was wounded I am quite well off and the orderly will buy fruit for me in the town I expect you are surprised to get a letter when I said on the post card that I should only be allowed to write once from this hospital but a fresh order has come out and one letter a month is allowed Well I have written quite enough about myself I think I am longing to get a letter from you and mother it seems ages since I heard from you Have you taken a house in Uxbridge yet or are you waiting until Auntie and Uncle move there I do hope you are getting a little more used to the lonely house Please remember me to everybody and give my love to all relations next time you write and tell them I should like to hear from them if they would write although I shant be able to answer their letters Have you heard how Frank is getting on I meant to write him but put it off too long I expect my kit has been sent home hasnt it I am afraid your field glasses are lost as I left my equipment in the wood when I was hit I am awfully sorry if they are but perhaps one of the men picked them up I arrived here with only one boot and only one puttee so will you send me a pair of puttees and a tie out of my kit I shall be supplied with boots when I leave here which wont be for a while I expect One thing I shall be very glad to get will be some books We are very well treated here and the Belgian sisters from the convent are very good and often bring us grapes or apples I didnt get a very long run for my money did I It is rotten being out of the show not that I wanted the war to last long far from it but while it was on I liked to have a finger in the pie but it is no good grumbling and the best thing to do is to hope it will soon be over so that I can soon be home with you both again Please give my kind regards to Kate Very best love to you both Cheer up and dont worry about me Your loving son 2nd Lieutenant Mayo Charlie PS I hope you can read this it is awkward writing lying down Several months ago when we relieved the French of these trenches it was noticed how quiet the atmosphere was and it seemed quite in keeping with the beautiful hilly scenery Since the British occupation however things here have livened up considerably and it has been found necessary to greatly strengthen the trenches and make dugouts much deeper and safer because of the various kinds of souvenirs sent over from the enemy Their latest was the aerial mine of which no doubt you have read It is exactly like an oil drum to look at with wood ends and explodes with a terrific report I dont think it can be fired from a gun as it comes tumbling across in such an awkward manner I dont think we manufacture these articles at Woolwich as we can afford decent shells We are not troubled very much by German artillery but they make up for that with trench mortars and rifle grenades As a signaller I escape some of the hardships of trench life especially now the winter has arrived and much prefer duties which keep one under shelter to those of exposure at the parapet Of course we have exciting times when any wires are cut by trench mortars etc and which need to be repaired at once wherever the break is Just lately I am having a lot of experience at making and fitting fireplaces in dugouts We generally use biscuit tins to hold the fire and rummage among old houses in the village nearby for pieces of piping to take the smoke out usually through the entrance as it is impossible to cut a hole through the roof on account of the sheet of iron Fuel for burning is generally a problem but a small supply of coke is allowed and we add to it all kinds of wood etc When sitting up at night it is surprising what good time we keep when waking up the next fellow to carry on if there is no fire but if a good fire is on we get quite generous and dont mind allowing the next man an extra hour or so to sleep We have had several days of rain this week which doesnt tend to improve life in the trenches or out On our journey to billets last Saturday night we took a road through a wood constructed by the Royal Engineers It wasnt quite finished and in places was ankle deep in water so our march was more of a paddle Parts of this wood which is in a valley had been purposely flooded so the road had to be laid on faggots and will be a piece of work when finished We are fortunate in having dry billets with beds raised above the floor and a small fire Sheep skin coats have been issued to us and are very warm There is a fellow here now imitating a monkey and holding out a small cup to an audience seated on the beds while another chap is playing an accordion All we need now are top boots tall rubber waders or gum boots designed to try and avoid the problem of trench foot to paddle through the trenches There is plenty of water about but very little to drink or wash in It is a fine place for people who are good at finding excuses for not washing But there are very good hot water baths here only it isnt any good having a bath unless one really needs it on account of the colour of the water We do very well though for food and clothing both of which are good and well supplied and considering the many distant places it is sent from it speaks well of the splendid way our Navy is doing its bit Dear Arthur I really must make this effort to write to you and let you know how I am progressing Well so far as a little internal trouble Im keeping fairly fit now that the cold weather has started and on my present job I can doctor myself I am prepared to stick this campaign until further orders We are now in our winter quarters and a very nice place it is Right on the edge of the cliffs with a beautiful sea below it reminds me very much of Cornwall Then just across is the island of Imbros and the sunlight on those mountains is sometimes marvellous On a quiet warm day with the birds singing one wonders if there is a war on but the blooming shells soon drive that idea away Its jolly cold now though but we have been served out with nice thick underclothes and waterproofs and top boots and except for always living in the ground our comforts have been looked after as far as possible Our food is as good as anyone could want also Im now used to a lot that before Id turn my nose up at and so long as the ships can land the goods I dont think we shall be so badly off Mind it does blow and the sea gets awfully rough and then no ships can come near us We have the sea on three sides and the Turks on the fourth so we are truly between the devil and the deep sea The Turks still find some ammunition from somewhere whether our guns and the warships knock the very dickens out of them Its very exciting to watch a battle especially now its on our side the guns are not like at Antwerp where we were the ones potted Now I am too sleepy to continue and as the firing has quieted down Im going to sleep and continue tomorrow 51215 Ive not had a chance to finish this letter before so here goes Weve had snow and rain and thunder and such lightening and Lord it has been cold everything frozen and even the water in my water bottle But today has been beautifully mild and calm almost like summer again I have just received a packet of letters from my wife written at different times since May so am still in hopes that there may be some more back dates knocking around the world for me We had three men killed last night in a little spasm and today our guns and the Turks have been flinging dirt at each other We used to duck once upon a time as the shells came over but now everyone seems curious to see what sort of a burst it will be and how much dust is knocked up and heaps have cameras taking photos Enclosed is a bit of heather which grows in great profusion all over the peninsular And the troops use in the trenches to boil their dixies on And now about the office Do you know but its quite an effort to remember the routine now I suppose Mr Millow is still with you and is there any chance of HRH Goff joining say as a SC probably Senior Clerk There is now a singing in the air and bang just as I write theyve dropped one over to us Sometimes a shell bursts and when we are working at something we dont even know its come along Its funny what you can get used But to get back to the office I expect you have heaps of ladies there now lord I havent seen a woman since April What do they look like I expect they scent out the office and how careful you all must be not to swear We often laugh here at the thought that if ever we do return to civil life again well be digging a little hole in the garden to live in and stirring up our tea with a bit of stick or our finger and just spit on the floor when smoking and if a little tickling in our shirt just hopping it off in the street I am out of paper he is writing this on envelope but it dont matter How are the lambs going Heres one thats doing a little doing a little bleat far from home Id like to come you know and have a rub at a bed and a roof also a drop of beer perchance Living in a hole for seven months now and the blue sky above gets a bit monotonous at times especially when the dirt will persist in falling on your face when you are trying to sleep and when it rains youre up to your knees in no time and thats always at night We had rum served out tonight and do you know I cant bear the stuff just pause and think by the wayside I cant drink rum in fact I hate it How we do change by time Now how is everyone down the club Remember me to Emmie and Mrs Fellows and May I understand that Mr Welsh and Mr Davies have been awfully kind to my wife and I reckon its jolly good of them This war seems to have found me so many kind friends I dont know what Ill do to repay them all if I live through this What has become of Beaumont and Jackson and is my pal Jimmy Edwards still alive Bert Id like to send you a Turkish shell but the post office wont accept them for transit anyhow perhaps Ill bring home a nose fuse for a paper weight Do you know back in the summer I had a shell drop just off the seat of my trousers and it did not explode Kaw It was a bit of luck I didnt stop to pick him up though in case he changed his mind later Well now Ive tried to remember everyone but do you give heartiest good wishes to the office for a Merry Xmas and a victorious New Year and trusting youll all be safe from Zeppelins Yours very sincerely T Harold Watts The last time I wrote I think I told you we had lost our comfortable job on railheads We have been shifted from General Headquarters and are at the most godforsaken hole there can possibly be in France We had a rotten journey raining all the time Reveille was at 4am and we eventually left the station about 10am The accommodation consisted of the old cattle trucks and rations of bully and biscuits It was a very cold and uncomfortable journey We arrived at our destination about 430pm and after standing in the rain for 2½ hours with full pack on we set out on a ten mile march Its the worst march Ive ever done The majority of us at the finish were absolutely knocked up and were only too glad to crawl into the billets before going to bed which was about 12pm They gave us a mug of tea the first we had since six in the morning and best of all a ration of rum The up to date soldier kit to carry about from place to place consists of 150 rounds of ammunition inside the pack overcoat fur coat two pairs socks one pants one shirt ground sheet iron rations emergency food supply Outside pack Mackintosh and mess tin in haversack cleaning kit hold all 24lbs rations soap and towel and on top of that extras such as handkerchiefs plate mug tobacco etc two smoke helmets in a satchel slung over the shoulder a respirator in the left flap of a tunic and field dressing on the right and of course the rifle in all its no light weight on a long march it takes all ones strength and staying power to keep going We are billeted in a barn and have a sea of mud to get through We have no boards so sleep on the ground fires are not allowed in the billet and at night time its devilish cold In the village there is a little general shop now nearly sold out one pub where they sell something they charge 2½d for and call beer there are no shops of any description and of course no amusements Rations are not so good now todays dinner Sunday bully beef stew and two potatoes between 35 men We have a loaf and a bit small loaf and two tins of jam between seven men the short bread issue being augmented by the world famous army biscuits Our captain is a perfect gentleman and about the most popular man in the regiment the junior captain an absolute sport and the platoon officers are all very decent sort of fellows We appear to be much better off in this respect than before and certainly think that D Co has got as good a selection of officers as any other company in the battalion One of our fellows ran across a number of Audit REs and they enquired after Maggs and myself Freddy or Whats left of him after some very stiff marching Dear Mr Hunt I expect you have heard at the office about me being in England suffering from gas poisoning and as it is quite a long time since I last wrote to you no doubt a few lines will be acceptable to explain matters We left the trenches at Vimy Ridge on July 5th and marching back about 14 miles we eventually reached a village named Ostreville for the purpose of having a divisional rest The signallers thought an orchard would be very convenient to erect bivouacs in so when we were busy carrying out this idea an old Frenchman appeared at the scene and raised objections However he agreed at last to allow us in at one end of the orchard thinking I suppose that we would wander about his place We had an enjoyable time here for six days and then had to return to our old billets near Mount St Eloi until the whole of the division had retired We guessed by this move that our rest was over and the following days were spent in marching and travelling by motor lorries and train until we arrived at Mericourt Station on July 21st near Albert After a delightful swim in the river near the billet we marched off the following night to take part in the big push We slept in an open field that night near Fricourt farm and were rather rudely awakened by a few German shells landing near us For five days we were lying in reserve in this district and occupied our time in watching an army of men at work in the valley making roads railways boring for water and laying down water pipes also practicing attacks in the old trenches It was very interesting to see the great amount of artillery busy practically all day and night and to read their messages sent by visual signalling often using lights from a ridge across the valley Our period in reserve being up we moved to Mametz Wood to lie there in support for five days before going into the trenches at High Wood On arrival at the edge of the wood at night we were welcomed by a big dose of gas shells and shrapnel which was applied steadily throughout the night by the German artillery Having to assist in putting our signalling gear into a hole for safety I was prevented from using my respirator for the first quarter of an hour as we could not see on account of the darkness and dust made by the ammunition columns rushing along the road and it was during this time that I must have breathed in enough gas to put me out of action Afterwards of course respirators were used when we were settled in holes by the roadside for the night I remained with the battalion until I was sent to the casualty clearing station on August 3rd and reached Rouen hospital the next day I had to wait until the 9th and crossed the channel from Havre to Southampton on the New Zealand ship Marama with about 800 other patients the day after It was a splendid boat with every convenience for carrying wounded men and the sisters and orderlies were colonials It was last Friday week when I arrived here and must say it is very comfortable and quiet I had to remain in bed until last Saturday but of course I cannot do any route marching yet So I have to take life quietly which is no hardship I can assure you after France I am on an ordinary diet and taking medicine I hear you have Mr Symons back again is that so And is he back in the same old spot I hope he is pretty fit although I suppose there must be something wrong with him to be back again I suppose things are as quiet as usual with you Have you had your holidays yet This is about your time I believe I shall be glad of a few lines when you have time to hear the latest about the office I hope you are keeping fit also Mr JB Taylor and Mr Woodhams and with kind regards to you all Yours sincerely Frosty PS It is a treat to write a letter without the censors shadow over one Dear Mr Hunt Thanks very much for your letter which I received a week or two ago also for the magazine We are in the trenches just now In fact we seem to spend about three times as much time in as we do out Also we are in a pretty warm spot it was about here towards the end of last summer that the French and German had some of the fiercest fighting of the war The country around about is a veritable maze of trenches The fighting at one time was so fierce that there was only time just to bury the dead in the sides of the trenches and now that the trenches have crumpled one is constantly seeing the bones of mens legs or their boots or skulls sticking out from the sides of the trenches pleasant eh There will be a pleasant smell here in the summer I only hope we are not here then In places we are only about twenty yards away from Fritz and company Consequently all times the air is pretty thick with bombs grenades and trench mortars These last are pretty hellish sort of toys They have an explosion like about ten earthquakes rolled into one But even these are not the worst we have to put up with The trenches being so close together there is of course any amount of mining going on So one never knows when the particular lump of earth one is standing on is going to take a trip through the solar regions When a mine does go up there is some excitement knocking about I can tell you Suppose for instance we were going to explode one all the artillery in the neighbourhood is ranged on the spot and directly the mine is exploded there is hell let loose on the crater Of course as soon as he gets the range the enemy replies so that the air is fairly full of everything that kills quickly One can on these occasions always rely on a good many casualties Since we have been in this spasm there have been five exploded in this neighbourhood while others are expected to go up at any time So much for conditions here How is everything in town Pretty quiet I suppose I see youve had the zepps Zeppelins over again Is it a fact that one dropped in the Thames Lines censored That is about all the news so will close kindest regards to everybody Yours very sincerely Gilbert Williams Dear Mr Smith I hope you will accept my apology for not writing before It has not been want of will it has been lack of opportunity I wonder how you all are I am fairly well now but was very queer for several weeks recently I also often wonder how you are all getting on and should like to hear A matter of about five minutes ago Fritz was bombing us and I have just got up off the ground where I was laying for about twenty minutes One fellow has been hit but not severely by shrapnel This is his second visit this evening It will soon be twelve months since I left you It seems a very long time ago I am afraid I have very little I may tell you so will conclude by asking you to accept my best wishes for the New year and desiring that you will remember me kindly to any enquiring friends Believe me dear Mr Smith sincerely yours W Wiggs Sunday Dear Charlie How are things going with you now I expect like the rest of us will be glad when the better weather sets in for there is no doubt about it it has been rough lately Since I last wrote to you we have shifted to another part of the line and it is a warm shop for both sides must have all guns they can find and it is nothing but one long duel all day and every day but thank goodness it gives over a bit a night so that one can get on with their work You see of a night the flashes of the guns can be seen so plainly that is why they do not fire a lot then Just on our right our people retook some trenches we had lost oh what a rough time the poor devils had snow and mud as much as you like and they had to lay in it for two days and grub could not be got to them I expect there have been a few more from Paddington called up by now it seems if the authorities mean to have all the men they want and if they cant get them one way they will another and it certainly looks as if they will be wanted for out here One cannot see any signs of an early settlement I see by the papers that the air raids have been busy in England again I suppose you have not seen anything of them yet has Rory Moore had any more frights We have the taubes German aircraft over our hospital nearly every day or night and I can tell you we got some starts at times The nearest we have to them since I have been here is just one yard from the main door at 1230 it blew in two pairs of double doors and shattered on end of the building to bits but not a great deal of damage to life which after all is the main thing The arrangements we in work is five or six days up the line and four or five down if you are lucky Of course at times these arrangements go to pot when there is an attack and we get a warm time and I should like to enlarge on these things but of course you understand I cannot Give my kind regards to all and trusting you are well Yours Will Dear Mr WH Davies Just a line to let you know I have not forgotten you I received a letter on Tuesday 3rd of January 1917 which you sent to me on August 24th 1916 By the marking on the envelope it has been round to various regiments and officers but it has arrived quite safe at last I received the letter you wrote in October quite safe I am sorry I have not written before but we were rather busy when I received your last letter and we could not send more than a field card for about a month Well I am pleased to tell you that I am still going on first rate I expect you will be surprised to hear that I have left the Northamptonshire Regiment and am now attached to the Army Printing and Stationary Services We are opening a new branch in the photography line and I am here as a photographer I am unable to tell you more than this up to the present I expect Harry will be pleased to hear this as he used to give me quite a lot of tuition in this respect There are only two of us here up to the present and as the dark rooms are not finished yet we are having an easy time The Officer is away in England just now getting some more photographic apparatus so we are on our own and I am in charge We are billeted with a company of Australian electricians mechanics mining and boring engineers and are having a fine time There are a good lot of fellows and make us very welcome We had a grand Xmas with them and they know how to enjoy themselves You can understand what a change this is after being in the line Just before I came on this job we had over a month in and out of the line waiting to go over the top when the weather was favourable We went in for four days then out for a rest for about three days then back again The water was over our knees in the trenches and it was impossible to use the communication trenches at all We were holding the front line with two platoons I should say our boys section of the line Our platoon was twenty two strong including the Officer and during the bombardment we had eight put out in ten minutes There were no dugouts of any description there so you can imagine what it was like to stand there for four nights We hoped the weather would be alright so that we could go over and get it done with but it was not to be We were out digging one night when they let us have it for five hours with gas shells we had two chaps hit with them and put right out The sights and smells were awful as a good many of the chaps lay just as they fell during the advance It was impossible to bury them Also there were about a dozen dead horses round about in the mud that were killed by shell fire while bringing up ammunition for the guns Our guns never cease down there as soon as one section stop another lot open out so you can tell there is Somme noise The last time we came out was for forty eight hours rest then in again and over but the troops were in such a bad condition that the doctor sent in a report saying we were not fit for the line so two other regiments in our division went over in our place We were held in reserve and I am glad to say not required after all Well I think this is about all for now I have been with the AP  SS since December 1st and I can tell you I hope I shall stop here I have no desire to go back to the line Kindly remember me to all old friends With kind regards to yourself and all on Section 4 Yours sincerely HA Skilling No 2 Section Advanced Section Army Printing  Stationary Service Dear Mr Taylor No doubt you think that I have forgotten all about you and my friends of the Audit but never let it be said this is an army term if you please Truth to tell I have been going to write time after time but have had to put it off for various reasons I am taking this opportunity of writing to you while I am in charge of tonights guard I get this job about once a week now its not so bad I have three men and a man in waiting we mount at 5pm and dismiss at 7am We make ourselves as comfortable as we can in the guard tent which just covers over the top of the sand bags and these have got grass growing out of them now The sand bags  are about 4ft high and make a good protection April 1st I got my two stripes up after being a 1st Air Mechanic for 12 months the NonCommissioned Officers have a very decent mess here and everything is ok I am corporal in charge of wireless photographic electrical and all instruments used on aeroplanes I have had a very good education on all those subjects but the one I like best is the wireless its far more interesting than photography which is a very big thing indeed out here and a lot depends upon a good photograph of the Hun lines Yesterday I saw a nice little game between one of ours and one of theirs after our antiaircraft fire had taken it up a bit higher our machine went for it and got well over the top of it then two more of ours came along and forced it down she tried all manner of tricks but down she came alright and landed a clean machine not broken in any part and the two Huns inside it quite well We gave a revue theatrical show to our chaps here on the 13th it went off alright we started at 9pm and gave a two hours show am enclosing programme and will forward a photo of myself as the oldest inhabitant as soon as I receive them from the Frenchman who took themKind regards to all of the section and the remainder of the agreements and hoping you are fit and well Good bye Yours sincerely FR Morris Dear Charles Just a line to let you know I am getting on fine I have been in France since Good Friday morning Well it is not so bad but of course not so comfortable as the office work We had the Lord Mayor of London over to see us the other Sunday when we were resting he made a little speech How are all at the office You might remember me to Mr Woodhams Mr Jones and Mr Cowan and the boys also the girls I suppose Mr Redford has retired by now We have been in the trenches since the 13th and I expect we shall go out shortly Our little dugout has just been flooded out a very heavy thunderstorm but we have run it out It is rotten to see how the towns have been shelled to pieces I dont suppose they will ever be rebuilt My brother was home on leave some time ago that is the second time so he has not got off badly He has been promoted to Sergeant now He seems to be getting on fine Have you seen Ernie Smith How is he getting on is he still in the APC Army Pay Corps nonfighting troops As I hear a lot have been transferred into line regiments Well heres to the time when the war is all over and we are back in the same old place The trenches where we were are only 25 to 30 yards from the Huns so had to keep a bit low My address is 3343 Lance Corporal J Davies No 1 Platoon D Company 6th City of London Rifles BEF France You might drop me a line to let me know how you are getting on and any news Kind regards The worst has happened The War Office has sent us down to this place which is miles from nowhere The camp however is made up of hundreds of huts is according to the old uns at the game the finest they have ever been in certainly everything is alright but the place is so muddy and my time is split up One half getting frightfully dirty and the other getting myself clean again However its all in the game and cant be helped There are twenty to a hut The beds are three long boards on two trestles about eight or nine inches off the floor a straw mattress and a straw pillow and four blankets Not a bit what I have been used to However I am now quite comfortable in it and sleep like a top Marvellous how you think we settle down to it Dont you think We rise at 630am Breakfast porridge and bacon at 730 Parade at 820 Drill till 1030 Then half an hours rest Then more drill up to 1230 Dinner at 1 oclock meat and two vegetables and sweets Parade again at 220 Then more drill which brings us up to 4pm We are then dismissed for the day Tea at 5pm bread butter and jam After which we can do what we like until 915 By this time we have to be in our huts for the final days roll call and at 10pm All lights have to be out Thats what my day consists of at present It may not seem much and really it isnt but I am half the day cleaning up The grub is alright but there is not quite enough of it at present I think however this will be right as soon as they have made all necessary arrangements For the time being the NonCommissioned Officers seem to be a little overworked This is the same every day varied on two mornings a week with a long route march in the morning Of course we only have half a day on Saturday and only a Church parade on Sunday So altogether things are not so bad The only thing is I cant get away for weekends as it would take up most of the time to travel to London and back I shall try however and run up to town in a few weeks time if possible I had meant to write to you when I could tell that I was definitely settled but as it now seems that some time must lapse before that happy consummation I decided that I would wait no longer Felixstowe is the largest and most important of all the home stations It is an experimental and educational station ie all sorts of machines and inventions are given a chance here and a large number of young officers are taught to fly sea planes There are between seven hundred and eight hundred men on the station the greatest proportion being mechanics So you will readily appreciate that the work of the Stores Officer is no sinecure Another man was sent down with me for training he served in Gallipoli with a machine gun section and afterwards worried the Senussi a reference to Western Desert campaign in North Africa in an armoured car and as he collected eight machine gun bullets in his anatomy he was sent home and down here for stores work He is an exceedingly good chap and my great chum The stores here were being temporarily carried on by the carpenter a commissioned Warrant Officer and it was quite thought that I or my friend would be appointed as a matter of fact I was recommended for the post and was halfway through the muster stock taking and only awaited confirmation from the Admiralty But today orders came to stand at ease and it appears that some other man is being sent here It is really no disappointment as I didnt care in the least where I am sent and I have now learnt enough to take over any old stores I will let you know when anything is decided Of the work of the station I cannot of course tell you much it is all intensely interesting and one really feels quite near the thing We have had four raids since I was here and they are truly fascinating We have a very lively six inch gun quite near our billet and when shes busy we begin to enjoy ourselves The boom of the falling bombs the crack of our gun the shriek of its shell and the fantasia of a dozen search lights provide a most excellent entertainment of course Harwich Harbour and our adjoining Air Station are objectives of the first order I shall be very glad to hear from you and to know any changes or events in the Audit office it all seems very far away and I cant see myself back there again I had fortyeight hours leave for my daughters wedding on the 23rd of August she and her husband leave for India on the 23rd instant a great wrench for me I suppose you will have retired before I get back but I hope we may not altogether lose sight of each other Regarding this over it seems all very tame but directly I want to say anything interesting I am brought up sharp Kindest regards to you and all my friends in the Agreements How are things going with you now I expect like the rest of us will be glad when the better weather sets in for there is no doubt about it it has been rough lately Since I last wrote to you we have

and I should like to enlarge on these things but of course you understand I cannot No doubt perhaps you had thought I had forgotten old friends at Paddington but such is not the case We so not have much spare time for letter writing now To tell you of all our adventures since we left England would take too long here to relate but I will save for when I come home Perhaps you have heard we were only at Farnborough four days before we were sent over there By God old chap we did have a time of it the first fortnight Living on bully beef and biscuits travelling day and night and sleeping anywhere and doing long tramps with full kit on nearly done us in as we had no training We managed to stick it through but I thought poor Percy Smith would have to give in as he was very queer with toothache The first six weeks we moved about from place to place doing all sorts of fatigue work bar our own Lambert Smith Collins and myself are now settled down in H the place where Mr Lakers son was so long at Collins and Lambert have been fortunate enough to get temporary clerical work during the last months I was promised one when on the 17th of last month I was wounded by a bomb from a taube which landed clean through our billet at 12 oclock at night when we were all sound asleep I caught it in the thigh but luckily it was only a flesh wound but I had some awful bruises from the debris which fell on it I have been in hospital ever since at the base but I am pleased to say I am now nearly well again and in a convalescent camp three miles from there overlooking the sea We are not allowed to put our address at the heading of a letter so I will put it here 2AM WP Mansbridge No16929 Royal Flying Corps No G 21 Hut no 6 Convalescent Depot APO S17 British Expeditionary Force After I am discharged from here I shall be sent up to the base and then up the line with the best of luck as the Tommies say out here I am hoping to get back to H as I was so happy and with such decent fellows there but I dont think it probable Lambert Smith and myself often used to talk of old times and wondered how things were at Paddington I daresay Gerald there are not many young fellows left in the Audit are there has Mr Horsley gone Do drop me a line when you have time as I assure you old boy it is a real treat to hear Paddington news I have never felt in better health army life certainly agrees with me also with Lambert Billy Button is at headquarters got a cushy job I believe I saw him once there but I have no idea where the other GW fellows are I am afraid I am not very fluent with my French yet I could have done with your services on several occasions How are Mr Slater and other members of the Stats or is that department disbanded Please remember kindly to them Just a few lines to let you know I arrived safely after visiting several places which I am not allowed to mention This place is quite oriental as the fronts of the houses are for the most part looked after and kept in repair while the backs are allowed to go and it gives one a shock to see a fine building in the front and then to go to the back and see it all neglected and ready to fall down It is very hot here during the day and the swarms of flies and mosquitoes keep one very busy and I dread to think what it will be like in the summer It seems strange to see oxen drawing carts and donkeys with packs on but it is a very common sight here I sometimes have to go to the big steamers in a small pinnace ships boat and when it is rough it requires some nerve to walk along the sides of barges that are pitching and tossing and then climb up the ships side by a rope ladder but it comes easier in time It is very mountainous here and we get a very fine view of Mount Olympus and the snowcapped peaks I had to go by motor up country the other day and I had to grip the side of the car as the roads are awful and sometimes there is only just room for the car to travel and a sheer drop on the other side The labourers at the docks are Greeks and when they are taken on in the mornings it is a regular Babel till the Military Policeman uses his persuader\\xa0truncheon right and left and that calms them somewhat I have not met Mr Coxs son yet but should I do so I will make myself known to him I have had to revert to sapper again as there are not sufficient men of our staff for us to remain NCOs but if it is brought up to strength I am promised them again The first person I saw here was Gray of the Stats Statistical Department and we are working together Trusting that you are quite well and with kindest regards to Messrs Cox Slater Rogers and Hunt Just a few lines to let you know things are going Am having a fairly good time nothing at all to grumble about I dont think I shall be going to France for a few months yet I met one of the chaps from the tickets department last week he is in the RFC down here Some of us were feet under canvas for a fortnight but owing to the wind and rain we were moved back to the huts When we were under canvas we used not get up till 8 oclock we were supposed to go on parade at 615am but we dodged that I enclose photo not dressed for the occasion outside our hut L20 or Hell 20 as it has been called I am looking forward to seeing some of the office chaps when I am able to get leave I hope your brother is getting on alright in France Hoping you are in the pink like myself I guess you wonder what has become of me after this long silence but you will see I am a good distance away from the homeland now I arrived here early in April and since the start have been getting on quite well You may be interested to know that Gray from your department is also here It is rather strange that I should rub against him The weather is brilliant cloudless skies day after day but it is very hot There are plenty of mosquitoes about They are very tantalising A net is practically a necessity for sleeping purposes I am billeted in a warehouse it is a very old place and has stood hundreds of years I should think according to its general appearance I have not picked up the lingo yet but French is chiefly spoken and I much regret not having studied it more when I had the opportunity at home This town is a queer sort of place as compared with some of the French towns we know and am sure I shall not wish to see it again when once I leave The cafés are not so gay as the French but I manage to have fun occasionally We have got a piano and gramophone to amuse ourselves with I hope we shall be able to have another trip to Paris when the war has cleared up but of course when is a question nobody can answer yet awhile Shall be very pleased to hear some news of you and conclude now with all the best I am sorry I have been so long replying to your letter but I have had my hands rather full just lately so hope you will not mind As I cannot get at my kit bag at present I shall only be able to write you a short letter because I have nearly run out of paper envelopes so I shall have to make up for it next time I expect you wonder what has become of me as you have not heard from me for such a long time The reason is that since the 20th\\xa0September I have been suffering with enteric typhoid The exact diagnosis of my case being para typhoid B I have not been up three weeks until next Friday but since I first got out of bed I have made splendid progress I was in an isolation hospital in France for six weeks and previous to that in a General Hospital for eight days I arrived here late last Wednesday night after a very decent journey This is a beautiful palace surrounded by a park in which we can walk about and we are allowed to go to the post office which is quite near I am quite happy and comfortable here it is a splendid hospital We have a concert or cinema nearly every night in the big hall Food is good and plentiful How long it will be before I am considered fit again I have no notion as a rule it takes months for a person to get right again It is a very funny and beastly complaint During to the whole time I have been in hospital I have received every attention and kindness During the months of July and August when I was in the Somme district I had a very rough time was nearly worked to death and had little sleep At one period we had to commence work at 2am but we were supposed to rest in the day but we could not get any However it was all in a good cause and we got through it Ambulance trains were loaded up at the station where I was and we saw some awful sights English and German wounded Perhaps I picked my fever up at this place but one never knows While I was in the isolation hospital in France I was kept for three weeks and two days on liquids but I am pleased to say that the doctor has now put me on ordinary diet With the kindest regards and best wishes to all I remain yours obediently Thank you and the other gents very much for the cigarettes which I received yesterday on coming out from the line We have been having exciting times lately Our division took a big part in this new advance on the Ancre In fact it was our Brigade that captured Beaumont Hamel and after two days hand fighting the ridge beyond the village We went over before day break on the 13th\\xa0November and from there till the evening of 14th\\xa0we were properly in the midst of it The greatest handicaps we had were fog and mud It is really wonderful how the boys kept their direction in the mist which was very thick while the mud began to swallow one up unless one was wary The Germans thought the village was impregnable and up to now it has resisted all efforts to capture it Their artillery and snipers gave us some trouble but once we were at close quarters with them they absolutely refused to fight and were only too eager to be captured For the most part they were a very measly looking lot and very young and some of them burst into tears when I pointed my bayonet at them By Jove Bertie those Germans look after their creature comforts Fine deep dugouts and any amount of shirts and socks and cases of soda water etc I got a souvenir or two a German helmet and one or two more things The worst part of the whole business was cleaning up the battlefield afterwards Thats about all the news Regards to the Audit agreements section and the rest of the boys Lines censored Just a line to let you know I have not forgotten you I received a letter on Tuesday 3rd\\xa0of January 1917 which you sent to me on August 24th\\xa01916 By the marking on the envelope it has been round to various regiments and officers but it has arrived quite safe at last I received the letter you wrote in October quite safe I am sorry I have not written before but we were rather busy when I received your last letter and we could not send more than a field card for about a month Well I am pleased to tell you that I am still going on first rate I expect you will be surprised to hear that I have left the Northamptonshire Regiment and am now attached to the Army Printing and Stationary Services We are opening a new branch in the photography line and I am here as a photographer I am unable to tell you more than this up to the present I expect Harry will be pleased to hear this as he used to give me quite a lot of tuition in this respect  There are only two of us here up to the present and as the dark rooms are not finished yet we are having an easy time The Officer is away in England just now getting some more photographic apparatus so we are on our own and I am in charge We are billeted with a company of Australian electricians mechanics mining and boring engineers and are having a fine time There are a good lot of fellows and make us very welcome We had a grand Xmas with them and they know how to enjoy themselves You can understand what a change this is after being in the line Just before I came on this job we had over a month in and out of the line waiting to go over the top when the weather was favourable We went in for four days then out for a rest for about three days then back again The water was over our knees in the trenches and it was impossible to use the communication trenches at all We were holding the front line with two platoons I should say our boys section of the line Our platoon was twenty two strong including the Officer and during the bombardment we had eight put out in ten minutes There were no dugouts of any description there so you can imagine what it was like to stand there for four nights We hoped the weather would be alright so that we could go over and get it done with but it was not to be We were out digging one night when they let us have it for five hours with gas shells we had two chaps hit with them and put right out The sights and smells were awful as a good many of the chaps lay just as they fell during the advance It was impossible to bury them Also there were about a dozen dead horses round about in the mud that were killed by shell fire while bringing up ammunition for the guns Our guns never cease down there as soon as one section stop another lot open out so you can tell there is Somme noise The last time we came out was for forty eight hours rest then in again and over but the troops were in such a bad condition that the doctor sent in a report saying we were not fit for the line so two other regiments in our division went over in our place We were held in reserve and I am glad to say not required after all Well I think this is about all for now I have been with the AP  SS since December 1st and I can tell you I hope I shall stop here I have no desire to go back to the line Kindly remember me to all old friends With kind regards to yourself and all on Section 4   My Dearest Will I feel I must write you again dear altho there is not much news to tell you I wonder how you are getting on I shall be so relieved to get a letter from you I cant help feeling a bit anxious dear I know how you must have felt darling when you did not get my letters for so long Of course I know dear you will write as soon as ever you can but the time seems so dull and weary without any news of you if only this war was over dear and we were together again It will be one day I suppose Dont think dear I am worrying unnecessarily about you because I know God can take care of you wherever you are and if its his will darling he will so are you to come back to me thats how I feel about it dear if we only put our trust in Him I am sure he will I wonder how your Cousins are getting on dear We are feeling very anxious about George as no news has come from him yet We cant understand why his wife doesnt write How are your hands now dear Mine are very sore so chapped and my left hand has got several chilblains on it and they do irritate I could scratch it to bits Have you been receiving the books I have sent you dear I am very pleased to say dear I am keeping very well indeed and I trust you are the same There has been a bit of a fuss over Arthur this week He has been trying to get in the Army unbeknown to his parents but Mrs T thought his parents ought to be informed about it so she wrote and told them about him and he had to go home in hot haste last night I guess he got in a fine row but he wont say today He is as miserable as anything Really Will I never saw such a boy as he is I am afraid he is going to the bad I dont know if Mrs T will keep him on or not He says he has to join up in a fortnight but as he is under age I suppose his parents could stop him I dont know whether they will or not For my part I hope he does go he will be a jolly good riddance for there is nothing but rows and deceitfulness going on where he is Well darling I dont know much more to say now so will close with fondest love and kisses from your loving little girl Emily PS Cheer up darling and dont worry about me I am quite alright only anxious to get your letters There is good news in the papers Love from Mum and Dad Dear Gertie I have written two or three times recently so you may get them together We have been very busy for the last few weeks and have got through a great amount of work We are much better off again as regards potatoes and other food stuffs for we have had a great quantity of stores I fancy we shall be here for a time yet anyway it looks like it with such a quantity of stores aboard You will see I am telling you the same things over and over again At least I know I have told you them once or twice but everything about is all of a sameness kind of thing Ships here there and everywhere now But soon we shall have a move that is when we can get through the White Sea We shall have to look after all the shipping The snow is fast disappearing now I came across an article in a paper the other day about this district and it said that 14 or 15 years ago bears used to roam around hear sic but there seems to be nothing around now excepting the wild fowl which are very numorous I believe salmon are numerous at certain times of the year The 2nd and 3rd of May we had a terrific snow blizzard We should have left the ship to go away and do some work on another ship but we could not get away from our ship it was so rough We have no night now the sun goes down but it never goes dark it is eternally daylight Of course I told you we have had an entire change round and I have a new job now part of the ship I have not half the time I used to have but I enjoy the robust work much better and I get to see much more with working away We get up at 630 and work until 100 so we put a few hours in dont we That is when we are working away Did you get the 100 I remitted Let me know I have remitted another 300 this month Let me know if you receive this also I shall probably send a little more next month or later Dont hold the paper money Bank it or keep it by you in gold until I come home Tell Dad I shall to him as soon as I can get enough to tell him about Give my best love to everyone at home I often think about you all I am yours ever Ted The soldiers at the front need more rest While in the trenches the water is over our knees most of the time The war is going to last some time yet and might be another twelve months before it is over The war has only just begun and its going to be a war of exhaustion After the regular armies have done their work it means that all the young lads at home being trained and disciplined and will take our place in the field The sooner people understand this the better it will be for the nation We have just come out of the trenches after being in for six days and up to our waists in water While we were in the trenches one of the Germans came over to our trench for a cigarette and then back again and he was not fired at We and the Germans started walking about in the open between the two trenches repairing them and there was no firing at all I think they are all getting fed up with it We started away just after dawn from our camp and I think it was about an hour later that we encountered the enemy They were on the opposite side of the valley and as we came over the brow of the hill they opened on us with rifle fire and shrapnel from about 900 yards We lost three officers and about 100 men killed and wounded in that half hour I do not want any more days like that one this section censored Anyway we drove the Germans back and held them there for eight days I cannot tell you all I should like to as it would never reach you I have not written to you for a long time but I have thought of you all the more as a silent creditor But when one owes letters one suffers from them so to speak at the same time It is indeed not so simple a matter to write from the war really from the war and what you read as Field Post letters in the papers usually have their origin in the lack of understanding that does not allow a man to get hold of the war to breathe it in although he is living in the midst of it The further I penetrate its true inwardness the more I see the hopelessness of making it comprehensive for those who only understand life in the terms of peacetime and apply these same ideas to war in spite of themselves They only think that they understand it It is as if fishes living in water would have a clear conception of what living in the air is like When one is hauled out on to dry land and dies in the air then he will know something about it So it is with the war Feeling deeply about it one becomes less able to talk about it every day Not because one understands it less each day but because one grasps it better But it is a silent teacher and he who learns becomes silent too I have an old platoon roll before me three pages of names numbers trades nextofkin religions rifle numbers and so forth Faces come back out of the past to answer to these barren details the face of this man dead of that vanished for ever Here and there rise memories of their habits their nicknames the look of one as he spoke to you the attitude of another shivering in the night air as he leaned over the parapet watching with tired bloodshot eyes Some of the faces have disappeared did I know you I censored your letters casually hurriedly avoiding your personal messages your poignant hopes We are now 150yd from Fritz and the moon is bright so we bend and walk quietly onto the road running diagonally across the front into the Bosche line There is a stream the far side of this  boards have been put across it at intervals but must have fallen in  about 20yd down we can cross We stop and listen  swish  and down we plop for a flare lights everything up it goes out with a hiss and over the board we trundle on hands and knees Still Apparently no one has seen so we proceed to crawl through a line of French wire Now for 100yd dead flat weedland with here and there a shell hole or old webbing equipment lying in little heaps These we avoid This means a slow slow crawl head down propelling ourselves by toes and forearm body and legs flat on the ground like it snake A working party of Huns are in their lair We can just see dark shadows and hear the Sergeant who is sitting down Hes got a bad cold We must wait a bit the moons getting low but its too bright now 5 am They will stop soon and if we go on we may meet a covering party lying low 510 515 525 530 And the moons gone The Bosch is moving and we crawl quickly on to the wire  past two huge shell holes to the first row A potent row of standards are the first with a nut at the top and strand upon strand of barbed wire The nut holds the two iron pieces at the top and the ends are driven into the ground 3ft apart Evidently this line is made behind the parapet and brought out the legs of the standard falling together All the joins where the strands cross are neatly done with a separate piece of plain wire Out comes the wire cutter I hold the strands to prevent them jumping apart when cut and Stafford cuts Twentyfive strands are cut and the standard pulled out Two or three tins are cut off as we go These tins are hung on to give warning and one must beware of them Next a space 4ft then low wire entanglements as we cut on through to a line of iron spikes and thick heavy barbed wire The standard has three furls to hold the wire up and strive as we can it wont come out By love its a corkscrew twist it round and then wonder of wonders up it goes and out it comes It is getting light a long streak has already appeared and so we just make a line of knife rests wire on wooden XX against the German parapet and proceed to return I take the corkscrew and Stafford the iron double standard My corkscrew keeps on catching and Stafford has to extract me twice from the wire his standard is smooth and only 3ft so he travels lighter He leads back down a bit of ditch Suddenly a sentry fires 2 shots which spit on the ground a few yards in front We lie absolutely flat scarcely daring to breathe  has he seen Then we go on with our trophies the ditch gets a little deeper giving cover My heart is beating nineteen to the dozen  will it mean a machine gun Stafford is gaining and leads by 10yd My God I think it is a listening post ahead and this the ditch to it I must stop him I whisper Stafford Stafford and feel I am shouting He stops thinking I have got it Do you think its a listening post There By the mound  listen I laugh Forgot that damned wire Our own wire outside our listening post The LP occupants have gone in Soon we are behind the friendly parapet and it is day We are ourselves again but theres a subtle cord between us stronger than barbed wire that will take a lot of cutting Twenty to seven 2 hrs 10 minutes of life  war at its best But shelling no thats death at its worst And I cant go again its a vice Immediately after I swear Ill never do it again the next night I find myself aching after No Mans Land   you must excuse me for being so long in writing as I feel like crawling into a hole and never coming out again Im the miserablest and sorriest man in all the world since poor old George was killed we were like brothers we were never apart out of the lines they used to call us husband and wife in Batt Battalion so you can tell how much I miss him I did not know he was killed until we came out of the lines either as he was transferred into the Machine gun section a few weeks ago and I was in the bommers sic its the first time we had been parted in the lines oh dear Jeanie the way I feel this last few weeks I wish I were gone with him Well dear little girl I can just imagine how you all fell feel at home being so far away but we will all try and cheer up and pray to God that we may meet in the next world everyone in the Batt thought such a lot of him he was so good and kind anyone that knew him couldnt help but like him and he had grown such a fine boy since he left Australia he must have stood six foot and was nearly 13 stone so you can guess how he filled out and grew I cant realise sic its true yet oh how I wish it wasnt every line makes my heartache no dought doubt poor boy he is better off but it is us that are left behind that will suffer all his dear ones that loved him so well but we will all bear up a little for poor old Georges sake he wouldnt like to see all so downhearted I am sure of that I am verry verry sic sorry to have to bring back old memories to all Georges dear ones at home but I know you would like to hear as much as you can about him he was never so happy as when he was in the lines plugging at old Fritz Ill bet he made the dirty wretches suffer this time with his machine gun before he died by what I can hear from one of the chaps that was near him at the time he was killed instantous instantaneous It was on the 5th of April at a place called Dernacourt word censored poor old boy was shot through the head as soon as we go up there again I will do his grave up with some flowers we are trasferred transferred into different Batt now there is words censored Well dear Jean I will close with deepest sympathy to all at home and with tons of love to all your sincere friend Aussy  Many thanks for your bright  chirpy letter of 16 October I have attended Church Parade this afternoon  after the dullest of dull services conducted by a Padre who it seems to me was quite without personality your letter was particularly welcomed Dont look to me to give your Parisian accent Firstly I think it most improbable that we will have any opportunity of visiting Paris which  compliment I will assume is the only fine place in this country Secondly I havent even as much bothered to concern myself with the easiest phrases I havent much time for one thing  certainly have no inclination I confess to having no love for the country or the people  I will should the War finish tomorrow I would be only too glad to say goodbye to the place for ever We are getting a taste of Winter alright The sun very rarely shines  we have a kind of daylight from about 8am to 4pm but it is rather dull  often foggy I am particularly well  in spite of commencing this letter in the strain I have written in excellent spirits After coming out of the Trenches this last time I wasnt too good for several days We had a hard time of It  to add to our trials had to tramp for about eight hours before reaching the Camp placed for us I had had practically no sleep for four days had lived in mud 18 thick thro rain  snow  felt absolutely done up I struggled into a hut wrapped myself in a couple of blankets  hardly stirred for over 24 hours I then made an effort to tidy myself My appearance when I had a look at myself in a mirror was mirth provoking beyond doubt A description is beyond me but try  picture in mud  rain soaked clothes hair unbrushed for a week face unshaven  unwashed for a similar time  still carrying much Trench mud  other varieties of that despised article We are now quietly billeted in a very small village As a matter of fact the village reminds me very much of the Homestead  outbuildings in a large farm These are all clustered together very old whitewashed  with thatched or tiled roofs The villagers are all poor The surrounding country is all agricultural  no matter which direction you take you will not find even the smallest area not under cultivation of some sort Of course there are no fences quite a feature in this country The county is interesting in a sense low hills rising  falling anywhere They build small Haystacks here  it would take three or four of them to make one of the usual stacks which we are accustomed to at home I shall be mighty glad to get home  I will have much pleasure in singing Good Company to your accompaniment We make a big noise at times As a matter of fact it it hadnt been for a few choruses the train journey we had a few days would have been unbearable I hope you meet with success as Schoolmarm I love that term Do you remember a novel called the Virginian by Owen Wisten very popular a few years ago The heroine was called by that title  a jolly fine story it was too Expect to be in the line overtimes We will be out I think for about another fortnight Trust we will have an easier time than last which was very serious Hope to hear from you often Perhaps next time may be more cheerful Feel that Ive been rather blue dull this time but blame the weather Many thanks for your letter which I have just received During the last few days I have been favoured too with letters from your sisters Carrie and Nellie to whom I have also written by this mail Well I liked you playing tit for tat as regards your name and address but the pencil Ive a good mind to purchase a dozen fountain pens and never write in pencil again Ill excuse your pencil writing this time but please try to imagine daylight from about 8 am to 330 pm and always dull when you are about to write again We have been through a pretty exciting time during the last month Was under another attack made under very heavy machine gun and rifle fire and had a dinkum fight with bombs I got through without harm which is rather marvelous This was our first time in the trenches Our second was a little quieter although we had a pretty big job on one night which was more than ordinarily dangerous The next morning we had our first experience of snow how would you like a little of it now after which it rained continuously all day and night We were relieved that night and then moved back to a camp taking eight hours to do the journey You might be able to imagine the state of the country after the rain It is nothing but shell holes which have been partially filled with water and the ground was slippery We were in a fine state when we reached our destination We are quite happy now however I have been away from the line for a fortnight and feeling much refreshed It was a great comfort to get a comfortable bed to be able to eat in a civilized manner at a table to be able to wash your face daily and even to have warm water for a shave We are billeted in a small village a very old place It is quite clean however and it is a treat to be able to move about on roads which were not a foot deep in mud Between our two tours on the front line we were camped in huts placed 150 yards off the road and the whole surrounding area was mud a foot thick It was glorious The roads werent much better the traffic on them being enormous Continuously a stream going each way the poor old infantry trying to wend their way through all this in constant danger of being wholly crushed by a motor lorry or else being trodden on by a heavy draught horse and collecting quantities of mud on uniforms and faces It is extremely cold but I think I can stand this alright It is so cold that a small lake on the roadside has remained frozen except where broken by idle stone throwers for several days I like this place and would be perfectly satisfied to be here for the duration It is very quiet but I never want much else than a quiet life when out for a rest The socalled rest consists of parades a greater length than we are used to in Australia but they are most essential in building us up after trench life which makes one horribly tired I am having a great time tonight writing to catch the mail which is leaving here next Saturday There will probably be very little opportunity again for a few weeks Many thanks for your congratulations It has been particularly gratifying to my vanity receiving numerous letters from my SA friends and it almost requires a superhuman effort to act and think normally However I am persuading myself gradually that I am only a very ordinary soldier who up to now has been exceptionally fortunate Before attempting a brief outline of my recent work I wish to thank you for the miniature photo which I like very much and am very glad to have I hope the time is not far distant when Ill have the opportunity of calling at 183 Archer Street and letting you see that I am still in possession of it And you mustnt allow such a long interval to happen again I enjoyed your last one immensely When I get home again Ill see that the detail about the size of the photo is put right I notice that you were staying with Chris Kneebones people when you wrote I wish he was with the battalion at present He was away sick in November and has not yet come back I understand that he has been doing well but I am afraid that he will be sent to the 3rd battalion in the next Division being formed in England If he were here at the present time he would have a splendid opportunity for promotion At present we are right forwards and as our work is done entirely at night I usually put in an hour in the afternoons writing letters to friends in SA  quite the most pleasing way of diverting ones thoughts and attention to the shelling that is always going on We were a long way back enjoying a fortnights rest before moving up this time One fine day we made a long march about 12 miles carrying full weight It was quite enjoyable particularly the latter part of the journey when we were in comparatively fresh country It is a great relief from the dismal area where the opposing forces held lines and trenches for so many months During the last eight or nine weeks we have made great advances forwards and the whole aspect is changed It is a wonderful tonic to everybody this pushing of the enemy back We were in tents for three or four days and these were more or less miserable having to do pretty heavy work in continuous rain The night we moved up here it was fine and ever since we have had fine days We have been here six days and the weather has been glorious Fine clear cloudless days  just a slight keenness in the air  and the nights moderately warm You would scarcely realize the difference in the conditions now and those of ten weeks ago Preparations are being made for another big push and practically all the work is done at night We have posts in the trenches which can be made more comfortable than usual Others have little shelters built into the sides of sunken walls I am at present in charge of the company I am attached to With a bit of luck I would have now been enjoying Blighty leave My OC was evacuated sick so I couldnt be spared conceit However it isnt too bad up here I am having some enjoyment in the way of letter writing You should just see my new quarters Where I am there is a sunken road as a result of many hours of work and it has now built into quite a  home Of course if a shell hit the bank Id probably get smothered and there is always the chance of shrapnel finding a passage in but such contingencies cannot always be provided for And if there were absolutely no risk what a dull show it would be  I dont think Maybe well be relieved up here in about a week when I shall in all probability be given my leave I feel that I could enjoy myself in spite of the fact that it is such a long time Please write some more chirpy letters and write them more frequently than has been the case lately Many thanks for your letter of 17th June which I received a week or so ago And the parcel I received that yesterday  contents just splendid Ive nearly made myself ill with the chocolate but please dont consider that when packing the next one The sugar is a bright idea Fortunately we not so unhappily situated as most civilians who have great troubles in getting this useful commodity It is a great stunt at country hotels now the people taking into the Diggers Hall their own sugar finding the allowance as regulated by the food Controller being insufficient for their needs It is hardly playing the game I suppose but I must confess that I was a guilty partner in a similar situation whilst on my leave a few days ago I am just finishing up my tour of duty here and return to France I think early next week just in time to get into a big dustup which has been getting ready for us for quite a long while However it has got to be done I suppose We cant expect to be having experiences such as I have been enjoying recently all the time I have had my ten days leave and return on Saturday night Four days I spent in London and most of the remaining time I was at Torquay in Devon In London I did the usual round of restaurants theatre and crowded much into the short time Torquay was lovely I never have had such a wondrous experience Devon is known as perhaps the most beautiful county in England and Torquay is possibly the prettiest part of that county I met some very charming and interesting people and for the moment I am madly in love with the country and the people To attempt any description of this beautiful place is quite beyond me and I will I am sure be thinking of it often so that by the time that I return I may be able to give you some fair idea Kindly apologise to Nellie and Mollie for their cards I will write at the first opportunity I received your letter of 25th November a few days ago Many thanks for your introduction to Miss Hall I had a note from her yesterday and if I am near Salisbury again I shall certainly call I wish I had known whilst I was with the Training Battalion as I could have got into Salisbury almost any time and would have been delighted to meet any one who had friends at home Although I have had a number of happy experiences and met many people I always feel that my enjoyment would have been greatly enhanced had I but had the society of old friends from home I am now at the Australian Corps School and am commanding the second division wing I have another officer to assist me also four Sergeant Instructors This is my first course here and incidentally my first experience in teaching You should be here to give me a helping hand We have 65 students 20 of which are officers and 45 NCOs As this course lasts for five weeks you will see that much work has to be done Being new to the game I had myself working pretty hard every night preparing the training for the next day Next course I should say things will be much easier I like the work alright and am getting quite interested There is much competition of course between Divisions to win the cups presented at the end of each course One is for aggregates one for musketry another for sports My Division at present holds the Sports cup and are going really well this time I have hopes that one or perhaps both of the others may also be secured We are at present on the spot where portion of the British line was held in July 1916 where the long Somme offensive commenced Within quite easy walking distance is the famous battle field sacred to Australia where it was that I first took a hand in this gentle game of war It is generally considered that never since that eventful July and August have we been under anything nearly so hot I am sure there will be thousands of Australians who will make a pilgrimage to this place after the war It would be a grand thing if a particular area could be granted to the Australian Government which I believe too is quite possible I am wonderfully fit and well and to my shame say that in these days of food shortages I am getting fat I do not know how to start this letter The circumstances are different from any under which I ever wrote before I am not to post it but will leave it in my pocket if anything happens to me someone will perhaps post it We are going over the top this afternoon and only God in Heaven knows who will come out of it alive I am in his hands and whatever happens I will look to him in this world and the world to come If I am called my regret is that I leave you and my bairns I go to him with your dear face the last vision on earth I shall see and your name upon my lips you the best of women You will look after by Darling Bairns for me and tell them how their daddy died h How I love you all and as I sit here waiting I wonder what you are doing at home I must not do that It is hard enough sitting waiting We may move at any minute When this reaches you for me there will be no more war only eternal peace and waiting for you It is a legacy of struggle for you but God will look after you and we shall meet again when there will be no more parting I am to write no more sweetheart Kiss the Bairns for me once more I dare not think of them my Darlings Goodbye you best of women and best of wives my beloved sweetheart May God in his mercy look over you and bless you all May he in that same mercy preserve me today Eternal love  Just a few lines dear to tell you I am still in the land of the living and keeping well trusting you are the same dear I have just received your letter dear and was very pleased to get it It came rather more punctual this time for it only took five days We are not in the same place dear in fact we dont stay in the same place very long we are having very nice weather at present dear and I hope it continues Fondest love and kisses from your I was so delighted to get your letter this morning and know you are quite alright I am pleased to say I am alright myself and hope dear this will find you the same I was so pleased to hear darling that you had such a nice enjoyable evening It was quite a treat I am sure I dont suppose you do get much amusement I am glad you are getting my letters dear I am not waiting until I get your letters dear now before I write because it would make it so long for you to wait for a letter and I guess you are pleased to get as many as possible I can understand darling your not being able to write as frequently I shall get used to waiting for your letters soon I guess but at first it seems so strange after being used to having them so regularly  Well darling I dont know any more to say now and I am feeling sleepy Oh I wish you were here darling but its no good wishing Fondest love and lots of kisses from Yes I have got used to the puttees as they have shaped to my legs by now And I am getting used to my other things now as I have been dished out with a rifle and bayonet and now when I go on parade I have got to wear my belt bayonet and cartridge pouch and also take the rifle They have been teaching us bayonet fighting today and I can tell you it makes your arms ache when you make a point that is when you lunge out at imaginary enemy with the rifle at arms length I think with this hard training they will either make a man of me or kill me You ought to see me in my Shrapnel Helmet and Gas Mask it would make you laugh especially as the helmet wobbles from side to side every time I walk Yes I got my food alright and you can have supper if you like to go for it and you can bet I always go for supper I am taking your advice and eating all I can Yes I did remember Dollys birthday and I have sent her a little badge of my Regiment which she asked for and which I expect you have received by now You will have to tell Miss Farmer that I think she will have to wait another two months before she sees me on leave I will see the officer about the allowance in a day or so as I have heard today that two or three boys mothers are receiving an allowance but I dont know how much Well I think I will have to close now As I havent anything more to say just at present Hoping you are quite well  It is a strange feeling to me but a very real one that every letter now that I write home to you or to the little sisters may be the last that I shall write or you read I do not want you to think that I am depressed indeed on the contrary I am very cheerful But out here in odd moments the realisation comes to me of how close death is to us A week ago I was talking with a man a catholic from\\xa0Preston who had been out here for nearly four years untouched He was looking forward with certainty to going on leave soon And now he is dead  killed in a moment during our last advance Well it was Gods will I say this to you because I hope that you will realise as I do the possibility of the like happening to myself I feel very glad myself that I can look the fact in the face without fear or misgiving Much as I hope to live thro it all for your sakes and my little sisters I am quite prepared to give my life as so many have done before me All I can do is put myself in Gods hands for him to decide and you and the little ones pray for me to the Sacred Heart and Our Lady I hope that you will not move out of the old house yet Write and let me know when anything happens I see that you went to Preston a few days ago It seems years and years since I tried to get drowned in the canal  With my dear love Pray for me Now barring accidents you will get to know all about it I know you will have a big surprise when you get this letter  I hope it lands without mishap If anybody in authority was to see it  Of course you have guessed by now where I had my first experience of the line Yes it was on the Ypres salient Oh it was a lovely baptism of fire that night We had to dig ourselves in and early in the morning Fritz started straffing Oh Lord if ever a fellow was afraid absolutely frightened to death it was this child Then one of my Section took shell shock when a big un dropped a couple of yards off the parapet and then the instinct of the leader or one whose place it is to lead came to the top and I became as cool and steady as a rock I had twelve men when we went in I came out with three Oh it was ghastly Perhaps you would like to know something of the spirit of the men out here now Well the truth is and as I said before Id be shot if anyone of importance collared this missive every man Jack is fed up almost past bearing and not a single one has an ounce of what we call patriotism left in him Noone cares a rap whether Germany has Alsace Belgium or France too for that matter All that every man desires now is to get done with it and go home Now thats the honest truth and any man who has been out within the last few months will tell you the same In fact and this is no exaggeration the greatest hope of a great majority of the men is that rioting and revolt at home will force the government to pack in on any terms Now youve got the real state of affairs right from the horses mouth as it were I may add that I too have lost pretty nearly all the patriotism that I had left its just the thought of you all over there you who love and trust me to do my share of the job that is necessary for your safety and freedom Its just that that keeps me going and enables me to stick it As for religion God forgive us all it hasnt a place in one out of a million of the thoughts that hourly occupy mens mind God bless you darling and all those I love and who love me for without their love and trust I would faint and fail But dont worry dear heart o mine for I shall carry on to the end be it bitter or sweet with my loved ones ever my first thought and care my guide inspirations and spur  u revoir my own sweetheart and God will keep you safe till the storms over with all my hearts deepest love Your own loving  As long as you kept your head down you were comparatively safe so as it went on this was where I had my first escape I was on sentry duty for a couple of hours from 1am to 3am and was instructed to keep a sharp look out I did not care for the idea of keeping my head above the trench and looking for beastly Germans however it had to be done it was quite uncanny to watch the enemy trench which appeared somewhat like a black wave and only sixty yards in front then you would suddenly see the flash of their rifles and machine guns immediately after would come the report and nasty thuds on the sandbags which you might be resting against I fired about five shots at their flashes the only target to aim at then another two shells which lodged in the parapet either side of my head leaving about 2 to 3 inches between me and certain death I thought that near enough but it turned out that it was to have something nearer than that Our casualties here amounted on the average to about two per day killed of course we thought it terrible at the time at least I did Early April saw us relieved by another division and we were sent a few miles back for a wellearned rest which consisted of physical drill and a run before breakfast The remainder of the morning being spent in platoon drill musketry drills After dinner we put the cap on our rest why so called I do not know by having a route march for two hours We spent a few days like this and were dispatched with all possible speed to Ypres here we went in to support the Canadians and spent a most unpleasant eight days during which time we lost several hundred men nearly all my friends who came out in the same draft and were killed or wounded we had to retire the best part being that the Germans did not find this out until two days after when we were more or less safely bivouacking in a very pretty wood We stayed here for about a week then we got to work again digging reserve trenches just behind the front line building up parapets which had been demolished by the enemys high explosive shells and such like working all night and getting what sleep we could in the daytime One morning we were awakened by the most awful din it seemed as though hell had broken loose shells were falling like summer rain And people have often told me in the course of conversation it was raining shells and I admit I took it with a grain of salt could not be possible I thought but such I was surprised to find was possible and actually taking place there about 330am This bombardment started and about half an hour later I with three others were ordered to start reinforcing We went up in fours it being considered safer that way half a mile over open ground we had to do this being swept continually with shells to give you a slight idea I can say the previous night just in front of our reserve trenches was a beautifully green field and the next morning it was as much as one could do to see any grass at all simply one mass of craters varying in diameter from ten to twelve paces I had gone about half the required distance when a shell fell only a yard from where I was the force of the concussion explosion pitched me several yards to my left and I came down rather heavily however I reached the first line without any further mishap where we had to stay until midnight when we had to be relieved again owing to not having enough me to hold the trench Our honours were one VC Victoria Cross two DSO Distinguished Service Orders one Military Cross and one or two DCM Distinguished Conduct Medals The next day I paraded sick my back paining me so much that I could not stand straight for a week after I am now back with the regiment who are on the line of communications We are having leave shortly and if possible will pay a visit to the Audit office Have you any news of Chichester Have just come through a particularly nasty period We went into the trenches on Wednesday night and on Sunday morning at 5am our Artillery commenced bombarding the German trenches and after 20 minutes had elapsed we went over the parapet My goodness what a reception the Huns had in store for us they simply swept the ground with machine gun fire and shrapnel It was found impossible to make any advance in our quarter so I dug myself in and awaited events It was horrible suspense as I seemed to be the only man untouched all around me and being personally acquainted with each man made matters worse in fact its all wrong to call them men as they were mostly mere boys About early afternoon I was hailed from the trench as to whether it was possible for me to get back I replied in the affirmative and decided to run the risk of getting potted on the way So I commenced crawling on my stomach until about a few yards from the parapet then made a spring and rushed headlong over the top nearly spoiling the features of a few who happened to be in the trench and were not expecting me We were relieved that afternoon but some of the fellows did not get in until nightfall and these experienced another bombardment Billy Hastings is quite fit and the only pal left We have been resting since but by all reports we shall be up again soon No rest for the wicked it is said and if true we must surely be a bad lot What a terrible thing about the Lusitania and with so many Americans aboard Should imagine there will be more trouble Have received box and letter dated 6th and am most thankful for everything you are all doing for me As regards the pads masks of cotton pads which served as gas masks all we were served out with were made on the spot and consisted of a piece of gauze and tape and were steeped in a solution of bicarbonate of soda prior to this charge I lost all my belongings except the Gillette razor so should be glad of a few toilet requisites when next you are sending a parcel Do not trouble about towel and perhaps Frank would get me a shaving brush Must now close Much love to all I am much nearer the front now and we moved here last Tuesday It was a long march and of course done at night and our present billet is a farm or the remains of one in a large village about ¾ mile from the trenches more north than we were before and nearer the Belgian frontier It is an awfully desolate spot and constantly under shell fire This morning I was trying to get a sleep on the grass when a shell burst in a tree not fifty yards away and sent a shower of leaves to the ground Fortunately no one was hit another burst in the same field ten minutes afterwards then I thought it was time to shift So went into a barn There are a number of dugouts around but they are so cold and you might get buried inside The farm is a vile place with a lot of stagnant water around and a lot of German soldiers are buried here The barn where we sleep would be improved if a shell struck the roof and ventilated it in our absence As the smell inside is bad and makes it nearly necessary to wear a respirator The rats seem to object to our company as they often have a free fight on top of us Last night was my first experience in the trenches and we returned to billet this morning The din is simply awful and just lately the big guns have been giving the enemy beans every night I am glad to say we had no casualties although the rifle fire was heard at times especially on our left where the Germans made an attack on the Indian troops The British gun fire was simply terrific all night and the Germans did not reply very much It was fine to watch the flashes of our guns at our backs although the screaming of the shells overhead is at first rather scaring to say the least of it However the news we hear from day to day at this part of the front is very cheerful and encouraging Yesterday I came across an Indian soldier who could speak English very well and he thought another month would see the war over also a German officer captured near here said it could not go on very much longer I for one hope these remarks will prove correct The church here is practically demolished just some of the walls and tower standing and the churchyard is in a bad state Great holes have been made and bones exposed In these holes is water sufficiently deep to drown anybody Great stone vaults have been opened and coffins and bodies can be seen Of course the place here is not inhabited except by soldiers I have been through some of the big houses and plenty of good carved furniture pictures fittings etc still remain in them I also have been in some of the gardens and roses just coming into bloom can be seen in great numbers I should like to see them at home Well I must close now and hope you are all keeping well Again thanking you all for our good wishes  My dear mother\\xa0It is Sunday again and mothers day at that so Ill have to take the Chaplains advice and write to my mother We were all at services this afternoon and he gave us quite a nice talk on our duties in writing home as often as we possibly could Sunday is about the only day we have in which to write anymore for by the time we finish our work during the weekdays we are either too tired or have no time to do it We took advantage of it being Sunday morning and didnt get up till 8 oclock Had a good breakfast of hotcakes bacon coffee and doughnuts We still have plenty of good food and one of the cooks is a pastry cook so we get doughnuts and cake every day or so We get our dinner in the field now prepared in those army field kitchens The stuff is cooked as the rig is pulled along the road It has been raining most of the time this week and is trying hard to do it today This is a great asparagus country around here for they have acres and acres of it The rows are hilled up like they used to fix the mud grafts in the nursery They cut it off about 6 or 8 inches below the ground just after the top shows for they wont use it after it has come up and turned green They certainly keep their fields clean and put in lots of hard work on it The girls do all or most of the work now that the men are away Two of us have an invitation out to supper tonight with a family near here and expect to have a good time The people are all very hospitable here and will do almost anything for us Just a wee note I am going over the parapet and the chances of a sub getting back alive are abut nix If I do get back why you can give me the horse laugh If not thisll let you know that I kicked out with my boots on So cheer up old dear and dont let the newspapers use you as material for a Saturdaymagazine feature You know the kind where the sweetfaced greyhaired little mother clutching the last letter from her boy to her breast sobbed He was such a fine lad as she furtively brushed the glistening tears from her eyes with a dish rag etc etc Im going to tell you this in case my company commander forgets Your son is a soldier and a doggone good one too if he does say it himself as shouldnt And if he gets pipped itll be doing his blooming job In a way its darned funny All the gang are writing post mortem letters and kind of half ashamed of themselves for doing it As one of our officers said If I mail it and come through the show Ill be a joke If I tear it up and get killed Ill be sorry I didnt send it  This is the first day they have allowed us to write letters since this battle began and I have no doubt you are anxious to hear from me Well we have lost an awful lot of our fellows and to those of us who are left it seems just a miracle that any of us came through alive How I did not get hit I do not know but I was one of the lucky ones that got through it without a scratch although I got several bullet holes through my clothes About two brigades of Canadians held about five times as many Germans It would have done you good to see the boys I did not see one show the white feather but each had a set face and went right at it We held the Germans and charged them back until they started to use that awful gas and they forced the French on our left to retreat So we had to retreat too or we would have been cut right off  It was just a nightmare a hell retreating across the ground with the Jack Johnsons digging great holes and the shrapnel raining down upon us and the bullets striking everywhere We could see the boys falling everywhere and it was just awful to hear them cry out  Thank goodness the Artillery and English reinforcements came up when they did and drove the Germans off Our machine gun sergeant is to be recommended for the VC He sure is a brave man and he is very badly wounded Our machine gun wiped out hundreds of Germans Poor Tom Smith of Cobourg Tom is gone I am very sorry for Mrs Bolster but Major Bolster died a brave death He was the last of his company to leave the trench and he had a smile on his face We have lost two of our guns and there are only eleven of us left out of the section Well all the boys did the best they could and I for one am ready to do it again only I hope the war will soon end for the sake of the poor parents wives and sweethearts of all the soldiers Still I thank God that I am spared and always pray that He will soon end the war  I thought I should write to let you know Im safe and Im recovering I miss you and the rest give everyone a hug from me and tell Rosie I hope shes being good The hospital is constantly got new soldiers coming in suffering from nervous exhaustion and shell shock too so Im not the only one the doctor said it is an injury to the nerves and told me to rest and they are putting in place electric shock treatment All the nurses are very sympathetic but sometimes when they think we cant hear them they call us all weak and say we are cowards Im not suffering as much as most a young gentleman has been learning to walk again yet he still wants to get back to the frontline Yes I am returning to the frontline soon so thats why I took this opportunity to write We had strict orders not to take prisoners no matter if wounded my first job was when I had finished cutting some of their wire away to empty my magazine on 3 germans that came out of one of their deep dugouts they was bleeding badly begging for them to be put out of their misery They cried for mercy but I had my orders they had no feeling what so ever for us  it makes my head jump to think about it One time I was in serious danger I was almost completely paralysed with fear I was sitting with Taylor a fellow soldier on the firestep of a trench during an intense bombardment when it seemed certain that we must be killed at any moment Shots fired around us each moment threatened to be the last I was conscious of biting the fabric on my top to prevent my teeth from chattering If I had been alone on that occasion I believe that I would be dead now it was the presence of others that saved me Since the last letter that was written directly from the battle under heavy shelling and infantry fire it has constantly continued that way  there is no word for it And not for that which followed Shooting slashing stabbing bashing It all took half an hour as the clock showed afterwards when things had calmed down There were no more Russians only corpses a few ragged dreadfully trembling prisoners otherwise all dead Heaps Heaps The first lines moved in with hand grenades behind them with rifle and bayonet behind them  unbelievable Unbelievable Multitudes with clubs and axes certainly only to finish us off like cattle those of us who had escaped the other weapons alive and were still breathing Dogs Dogs They had not yet known Prussian soldiers Certainly not There was no more mercy I have never experienced such a thing never want to experience it again and will never speak of it again Oh Wife Oh love Be strong Be brave It is all going well Surely Post even arrived yesterday morning I have just come in from a trip to the Orpheus by my lonesome The movie expresses my feelings to a T My it feels strange to be so near  and yet you might as well be 1000 miles away tonight I kind of hope against hope that when I turn a corner it may be to run into you Do I sound foolish you ask Isnt that what I used to say in my letters of last year Well Im there tonight whether foolish or otherwise What have you been doing today I supposed the same old studying I hope you practised hard for you just have to come out away up in your exams or you neednt tell me how you get along at all One chap has just come in the room feeling a little better than good if you know what that means and is trying to get into bed It is just the sort of thing to make one think and wonder how men came make such fools of themselves  I guess it is up to me to go over and take his clothes off now How strange it is I have to contrast it with my own case I have had a well I can almost say enjoyable evening at the show had an ice cream on the way up  the whole thing costing me about 25 cents  and now I am happy writing to you And the morrow what of it In all likelihood a grand day and I trust ending up with my little sweetheart and a kiss that I can feel now Have I not much to be thankful for Am I not lucky And should not my life show this good fortune if I may call it so in many ways There are some questions for you to help me in solving I often ponder over them and can only see one course ahead Well well Helen where am I taking you Away off into philosophy I suppose you will call it I venture to call it Life The grand the noble the fascinating problem of living Sometimes you know I think that I could be happy yes truly happy away off far from the bother of human uproar hidden away in some place of grandeur alone with you You have pictured it to me and I can see it but no dearie that would not be true happiness Im sure we would both tire of it in a very short while It would be gorgeous and lovely for a time but I think there would be a longing for a something that was not there I like sometimes to think of a different scene perhaps two pictures the first of a room filled with books and all the necessities of a library and you and I reading together Alice in Wonderland We are both tired for it is after a strenuous day and oh how we are enjoying it and are happy as happy can be Now honey Ive written in a very peculiar sheen but it is so long since I have written you and so much has happened since my last letter that I forget what you like me to say what you want me to say and what I want to say myself One thing I do remember you want me to put down in cold blue ink and even in blood so Ill try not to tease but feel the truth and say that I love you still First and most important I suppose that you have heard the news This time I think that it is sure and that we will be on the water some time this side of Sunday That is about all I can think of at present It does not seem possible after so many disappointments that we are really going The boys seem to be going crazy by tomorrow there will be no holding them There is to be a parade of every man in the battery then and the news will come to us officially My it is so long since I have seen you and so long since I promised to write you and again so long since talking with you that it is hard to find much to write about Writing is at its heart but a very poor apology for speech and when I think that it will be but a short time till I can tell you all the news my pen fails in its attempt to note down what I will only repeat on Friday if not sooner '"

    "__Perplexity__ is a statistical measure of how well a probability model predicts a sample. It is measured as the normalized log-likelihood of a test set. The measure is somewhat meaningless on it's own, but can be thought of as measuring how probable some new unseen data is given the model that was learned earlier. The benefit of this statistic comes in comparing perplexity across different models. The model with the lowest perplexity is the best!\n",

It is used alongside the perplexity to make up for some of the shortcomings of the the ambiguous perplexity measure. Coherence is based on the idea of semantics, where it measures a single topic by measuring the degree of semantic similarity between high scoring words in the topic.\n"
